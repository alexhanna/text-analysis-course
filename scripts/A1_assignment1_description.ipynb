    "# Assignment 1: Gender and Pronouns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment has multiple parts. Make sure you read the assignment very carefully and address every part.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Research has shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253291274_Gender_Differences_in_Language_Use_An_Analysis_of_14000_Text_Samples) that women use more personal pronouns compared to men. Your task is to further this research and explore whether there is a difference between the *magnitude* in the use of personal pronouns and possessive pronouns by men and women authors in our children's literature data, and whether there is a difference in the *way* in which they use these pronouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, here is a list of personal and possessive pronouns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, what, who, me, him, her, us, them  \n",
    "Possessive pronouns: mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you should write and submit a Jupyter notebook that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tests whether female authors use proportionally more *personal* pronouns, on average, compared to male authors in our collection of 19th century children's literature. \n",
    "2. Tests whether female authors use proportionally more *possessive* pronouns, on average, compared to male authors in the same collection.\n",
    "3. Compares the way in which one personal pronoun and one possessive pronoun of your choosing is used by male and female authors. Do this by showing what other words are used in the same context as the pronouns you choose to compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, in your notebook you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate and print the total number of personal pronouns and possessive pronouns used by female and male authors\n",
    "2. Create a new column that contains the proportion of total words that are personal pronouns for each row\n",
    "3. Create a new column that contains the proportion of total words that are possessive pronouns for each row\n",
    "4. Calculate and print the mean of the two columns from (2) and (3) for male and female authors\n",
    "5. Visualize the output from (4), including error bars\n",
    "6. Include one cell where you interpret this output\n",
    "7. Choose one personal pronoun and one possessive pronoun to compare\n",
    "8. Print out the words used in a similar context as your two chosen pronouns for all of the novels writen by men, and again for all of the novels written by women\n",
    "9. Include a final cell where you interpret this output, and suggest at least one implication of all of your calculations for our understanding of the social world\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the length of these novels I suggest not using a part-of-speech tagger. Instead, you may use a list of personal and possessive pronouns, as listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Depending on your approach, you may need to use a lambda function for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bring this completed notebook to class on Wednesday, Februrary 22.**\n",
    "\n",
    "###  In-Class, Wednesday, February 22\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, you will pair up with a classmate and compare and contrast your notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, as a pair, create a new notebook or document that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summarizes what you learned about pronoun use in the children's literature data.\n",
    "2. Provides three (3) further techniques you could use to extend this analysis (qualitative or quantitative). Explain how each technique would expand our understanding of pronoun use by men and women.\n",
    "2. Provides three (3) substantive questions about the social world this line of analysis could address. For this part you may propose additional corpora that could extend or expand this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the class on Wednesday you must submit, to bCourses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your completed notebook addressing the assignment questions above (which you may modify during class). **Make sure you rename your notebook, and include your last name in the file name.**\n",
    "2. The notebook you wrote with your classmate that compares your two approaches and summarizes what you learned about pronoun use in the data, and includes your three additional techniques and your three substantive questions. Only one of you needs to submit this notebook, but include both names in the opening cell of your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be graded on a three point scale (I may assign partial points).\n",
    "\n",
    "+1 for submitting the completed, original assignment  \n",
    "+1 for the thoughtfulness of your interpretation  \n",
    "+1 for the thoughtfulness of the comparison between your two notenooks and the three substantive questions \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thoughfulness\" will be determined by (1) whether or not your interpretation is approprate for the techniques you used and your output, and (2) how well your interpretation/questions relates to a humanities, social science, or science perspective on the social world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, this assignment, along with the second assignment, comprise 15% of your final grade."
