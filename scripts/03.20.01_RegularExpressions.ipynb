    "## Introduction to Regular Expressions in Python and Formatting Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adapted from a lesson written by Adam Anderson**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using Python's in-built string functions and NLTK to tokenize, count, and analyze strings. Today, we will be learning about another technique of text analysis that involves using a special type of code called \"regular expressions\". To implement regular expressions we will be using functions from the 're' library of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to gain an introductory understanding of how regular expressions can be used with large portions of text to cleanly pull data from the text. Regular expressions can seem overwhelming at first, but with practice, they become easier to use. The goal is to add the usage of regular expressions to your text analysis 'toolbox'! We'll use regular expressions in practice to transform text files into a pandas dataframe, and in doing so we'll learn about the os library and we'll practice using for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Outline:\n",
    "- Regular Expressions Overview\n",
    "- findall, sub, and more\n",
    "- Examples\n",
    "- Using split and re to format texts\n",
    "    - os library\n",
    "    - for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* regular expressions\n",
    "    * a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings.\n",
    "* for loop\n",
    "    * a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. \n",
    "* os library\n",
    "    * The os and sys modules provide numerous tools to deal with filenames, paths, directories directly in Python.\n",
    "* directory\n",
    "    * A directory is an organizational unit, or container, used to organize folders and files into a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Regular Expressions\n",

    "\n",
    "We have worked with Python's NLTK to tokenize words and sort/structure/manipulate them using the in-built functions. Regular expressions are an alternative way to 'search' for information within strings. At their most basic level, regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a pattern with which the computer searches. Regular expressions give us immense power by allowing us to search within extremly large portions of text for very specific types of text/information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are given a farm of various animals. Think of regular expressions as defining features that help us find exactly what we are looking for. In my farm, I want to search for animals that are brown, have 4 legs, and weigh more than 10 pounds. Each of those animal characteristics is analogous to a \"sequences of characters\" in the context of regular expressions. I may be looking for words that contain capital letters, or words that specifically start with a certain sequence of characters, similarly to how I am looking for brown animals, or animals with 4 legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below, we will introduce some basic regular expression code, and the findall function within the 're' Python library. This function will allow us to transform our confusing regex code into tangible results.\n",

       " 'Title: THE PRINCE\\nAuthor: Nicolo Machiavelli\\n\\n\\nTranslated by W. K. Marriott\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members of the old Florentine nobility.\\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Il Magnifico. The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\\'s literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOUTH — Aet. 1-25—1469-94\\n\\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo. Savonarola\\'s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in \"The Prince,\" where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo\\'s grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\"\\nMachiavelli, in his \"History of Florence,\" gives us a picture of the young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \"They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.\" In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: \"I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your share.\" Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOFFICE — Aet. 25-43—1494-1512\\n\\nThe second period of Machiavelli\\'s life was spent in the service of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of Machiavelli\\'s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters which illustrate \"The Prince.\"\\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forli\" of \"The Prince,\" from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft summarized in \"The Prince,\" and was consequently driven out. He, also, it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the faith of princes.\\nMachiavelli\\'s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\" Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare Borgia\\'s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the \"hero\" of \"The Prince.\" Yet in \"The Prince\" the duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.\\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.\\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.\\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany, with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\\'s character has already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his wishes.\\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\\'s official career were filled with events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITERATURE AND DEATH — Aet. 43-58—1512-27\\n\\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\" After describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men. And because Dante says:\\n     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,\\n     Unfruitful else,\\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have composed a small work on \\'Principalities,\\' where I pour myself out as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince, especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\"\\nThe \"little book\" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\\' Medici. Although Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\\'s lifetime, \"The Prince\" was never published by him, and its text is still disputable.\\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\"\\nBefore Machiavelli had got \"The Prince\" off his hands he commenced his \"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\" which should be read concurrently with \"The Prince.\" These and several minor works occupied him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on one pretext or another it was not promulgated.\\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he was much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\" It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance of Cardinal de\\' Medici to write the \"History of Florence,\" a task which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer observes that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play with.\"\\nWhen the \"History of Florence\" was finished, Machiavelli took it to Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\\' Medici, who had in the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Prince\" for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florence\" to the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.\\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten of Liberty and Peace.\" Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\\n\\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name, it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholy necromancer,\" which so long haunted men\\'s vision, has begun to fade.\\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII, overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to write the \"History of Florence,\" rather than employ him in the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"The Prince,\" its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\\'s contemporaries; yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and conduct.\\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"The Prince\" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon. Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be—and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses; prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to a higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to fight.\\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\\'s that government should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society; to this \"high argument\" \"The Prince\" contributes but little. Machiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests \"The Prince\" with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.\\nIn translating \"The Prince\" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. \"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\" In \"The Prince,\" it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare\\'s time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example: the word \"intrattenere,\" employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \"entertain,\" and every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power.\" But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians,\" etc., using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\\'s meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\\nPrincipal works.

In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.\\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in \\'84, nor those of Pope Julius in \\'10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III — CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.\\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.\\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico\\'s own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\\n     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\\n     Sforza, who married Beatrice d\\'Este. He ruled over Milan\\n     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.\\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.\\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority. Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\\n     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\\n     \"intrattenere.\"\\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.\\n     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"\\n     born 1462, died 1515.\\n\\n     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.\\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.\\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.\\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage.\\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\\n     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\\n     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\\n     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\\n     crown.\\n\\n     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\\'Amboise,\\n     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV — WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\\n\\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.\\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.\\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.\\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V — CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\\n\\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.\\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines.\\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE\\'S OWN ARMS AND ABILITY\\n\\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties. Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.\\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by force.\\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\\n     (*) Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\\n\\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.\\n     (*) \"Le radici e corrispondenze,\" their roots (i.e.\\n     foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other\\n     states—a common meaning of \"correspondence\" and\\n     \"correspondency\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.\\n     (*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married\\n     Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo\\n     Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his\\n     own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited\\n     agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-\\n     1507) during the transactions which led up to the\\n     assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and\\n     along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left\\n     an account, written ten years before \"The Prince,\" of the\\n     proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto\\n     dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,\"\\n     etc., a translation of which is appended to the present\\n     work.\\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.\\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\\n     (*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d\\'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.\\n     (*) Ramiro d\\'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.\\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+) was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\\n     (*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\\n\\n     (+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San\\n     Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.\\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\\n     (*) San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio\\n     Sforza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII — CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\\n\\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other modern—and without entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\\n     (*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.\\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one\\'s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\\n     (*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the\\n     modern equivalent of Machiavelli\\'s thought when he speaks of\\n     \"crudelta\" than the more obvious \"cruelties.\"\\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX — CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\\n\\nBut coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.\\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him.\\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them. But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\\nNabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on the people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged—such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.\\n     (*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under\\n     Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\\n\\n     (+) Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in\\n     Machiavelli\\'s \"Florentine History,\" Book III.\\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED\\n\\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country. And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his people.\\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year\\'s eating, drinking, and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and defend them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI — CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live. These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly—yet now a king of France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\\n     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.\\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander\\'s time. Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\\n     (*) Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\\' Medici.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII — HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\\n\\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them.\\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.\\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.\\n     (*) \"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\" This is one of the\\n     bons mots of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with\\n     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only\\n     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the\\n     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. \"The\\n     History of Henry VII,\" by Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had\\n     conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind\\n     of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of\\n     Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope\\n     Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into\\n     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,\\n     rather than with swords to fight.\"\\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.\\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed and quite free.\\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains. After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.\\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,(*) allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of Pitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\\n     (*) Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\\n\\n     (+) Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of\\n     Naples.\\n\\n     (%) Giovanni Acuto.

You must understand that the empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.\\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.\\n     (*) Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio\\n     in Romagna. He was the leader of the famous \"Company of St\\n     George,\" composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in\\n     1409.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII — CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE\\'S OWN\\n\\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,(*) for his assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.\\n     (*) Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of\\n     Naples), surnamed \"The Catholic,\" born 1452, died 1516.\\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles.\\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,(*) to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels.\\n     (*) Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.\\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.\\nCharles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one\\'s own forces. And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.\\n     (*) Charles VII of France, surnamed \"The Victorious,\" born\\n     1403, died 1461.\\n\\n     (+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.\\n     (*) \"Many speakers to the House the other night in the\\n     debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most\\n     lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the\\n     British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr Balfour\\n     replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under\\n     the weight of its military obligations, he said that this\\n     was \\'wholly unhistorical.\\' He might well have added that the\\n     Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen\\n     acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that\\n     it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer\\n     recognized.\"—Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.\\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength. And one\\'s own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And the way to make ready one\\'s own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV — THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\\n\\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.\\nPhilopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\\n     (*) Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks,\" born 252 B.C.,\\n     died 183 B.C.\\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV — CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED\\n\\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity. Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI — CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\\n\\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.\\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects\\' or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects\\' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.\\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII — CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\\n\\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\\n     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and\\n     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:\\n     \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\\n     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)\\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\\n     (*) . . . against my will, my fate\\n     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,\\n     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow\\'rs,\\n     And guard with these severities my shores.\\n\\n     Christopher Pitt.\\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.\\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.\\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII(*) — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\\n\\n     (*) \"The present chapter has given greater offence than any\\n     other portion of Machiavelli\\'s writings.\" Burd, \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 297.\\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\\n     (*) \"Contesting,\" i.e. \"striving for mastery.\" Mr Burd\\n     points out that this passage is imitated directly from\\n     Cicero\\'s \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,\\n     unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud\\n     proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad\\n     posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\"\\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind.\\n     (*) \"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad\\n     votum).\" The words \"ad votum\" are omitted in the Testina\\n     addition, 1550.\\n\\n     Alexander never did what he said,\\n     Cesare never said what he did.\\n\\n     Italian Proverb.\\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*) friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\\n     (*) \"Contrary to fidelity\" or \"faith,\" \"contro alla fede,\"\\n     and \"tutto fede,\" \"altogether faithful,\" in the next\\n     paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro\\n     alla fede\" and \"tutto fede,\" were omitted in the Testina\\n     edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal\\n     authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word\\n     \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as\\n     rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\" Observe that the\\n     word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the\\n     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of\\n     belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably\\n     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his\\n     Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as\\n     follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\\n     Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his\\n     political scheme: \\'That the show of religion was helpful to\\n     the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and\\n     pernicious.\\'\"\\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.\\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.\\nOne prince(*) of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.\\n     (*) Ferdinand of Aragon. \"When Machiavelli was writing \\'The\\n     Prince\\' it would have been clearly impossible to mention\\n     Ferdinand\\'s name here without giving offence.\" Burd\\'s \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 308.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX — THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\\n\\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.\\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.\\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.\\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\\n     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan\\n     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\\'s\\n     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from\\n     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had\\n     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the\\n     Boscoli conspiracy.\\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.\\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.\\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.\\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself—it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles—you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.\\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.\\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.\\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\\'s ruin.\\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.\\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.\\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX — ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\\n\\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.\\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.\\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\\n     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and\\n     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the\\n     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.\\n     A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the\\n     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote\\n     Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when. They\\n     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine\\n     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me\\n     at once.\" Cf. \"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini,\\n     translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI — HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\\n\\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him. Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.\\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.\\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.\\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state.\\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\\n     (*) \"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\" \"Arti\" were\\n     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: \"Arte . . . a whole\\n     company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\" The\\n     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr\\n     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\\n     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\\n     \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace\\'s\\n     \"Russia,\" ed. 1905: \"The sons . . . were always during the\\n     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger\\n     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind—\\n     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and\\n     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual\\n     members.\" The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity,\\n     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or\\n     \"arte.\" Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind\\n     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only\\n     another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental\\n     company.\" In both words the underlying idea is that of a\\n     body of men united by an oath. \"Tribu\" were possibly gentile\\n     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals\\n     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\"\\n     would be most appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII — CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\\n\\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.\\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII — HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\\n\\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, respect for you abates.\\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt.\\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything. This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\\n     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the\\n     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of\\n     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus\\n     became involved in Italian politics.\\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.\\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him.\\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV — WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\\n\\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.\\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years\\' possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV — WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\\n\\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\\n     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older\\n     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty\\n     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this\\n     miserable universe.\" Sorel\\'s \"Eastern Question.\"\\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.\\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.\\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.\\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.\\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI — AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\\n\\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\\n     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\\n     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\\n     title of Clement VII.\\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.\\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.\\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head. Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour.\\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince.\\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears. What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him? What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch:\\n     Virtu contro al Furore\\n     Prendera l\\'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\\n     Che l\\'antico valore\\n     Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\\n\\n     Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,\\n     And it i\\' th\\' combat soon shall put to flight:\\n     For the old Roman valour is not dead,\\n     Nor in th\\' Italians\\' brests extinguished.\\n\\n     Edward Dacre, 1640.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\\n\\nBY\\n\\nNICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.\\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.\\nThus it arose that, men\\'s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody\\'s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.\\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.\\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.\\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends. But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d\\'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke\\'s quarters, where they should be seized.\\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.\\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.\\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\\'s quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.\\nBut the duke\\'s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\\n\\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\\n\\n\\n\\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\\n\\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.\\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.\\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son\\'s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.\\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\\'s men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\\'s troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.\\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people\\'s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor\\'s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.\\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.\\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.\\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\" Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"\\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio\\'s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines\\' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.\\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy\\'s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio\\'s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio\\'s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.\\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\\'s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\\'s army. But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:\\n\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\"\\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\" answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less to me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the same.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not taken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and being told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesar died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.\" Having been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.\" He used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?\" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\" Castruccio answered: \"A helmet.\" Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\" On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\" Seeing on of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I pray God that you will let him feed you also.\" Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house from the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\" Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\" He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?\" asked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?\"\\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince, by Nicolo Machiavelli\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1232-h.htm or 1232-h.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/3/1232/\\n\\nProduced by John Bickers, David Widger and Others\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

       "  'Title: THE PRINCE\\nAuthor: Nicolo Machiavelli\\n\\n\\nTranslated by W. K. Marriott\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members of the old Florentine nobility.\\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Il Magnifico. The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\\'s literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOUTH — Aet. 1-25—1469-94\\n\\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo. Savonarola\\'s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in \"The Prince,\" where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo\\'s grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\"\\nMachiavelli, in his \"History of Florence,\" gives us a picture of the young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \"They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.\" In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: \"I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your share.\" Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOFFICE — Aet. 25-43—1494-1512\\n\\nThe second period of Machiavelli\\'s life was spent in the service of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of Machiavelli\\'s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters which illustrate \"The Prince.\"\\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forli\" of \"The Prince,\" from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft summarized in \"The Prince,\" and was consequently driven out. He, also, it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the faith of princes.\\nMachiavelli\\'s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\" Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare Borgia\\'s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the \"hero\" of \"The Prince.\" Yet in \"The Prince\" the duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.\\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.\\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.\\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany, with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\\'s character has already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his wishes.\\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\\'s official career were filled with events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITERATURE AND DEATH — Aet. 43-58—1512-27\\n\\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\" After describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men. And because Dante says:\\n     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,\\n     Unfruitful else,\\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have composed a small work on \\'Principalities,\\' where I pour myself out as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince, especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\"\\nThe \"little book\" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\\' Medici. Although Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\\'s lifetime, \"The Prince\" was never published by him, and its text is still disputable.\\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\"\\nBefore Machiavelli had got \"The Prince\" off his hands he commenced his \"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\" which should be read concurrently with \"The Prince.\" These and several minor works occupied him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on one pretext or another it was not promulgated.\\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he was much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\" It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance of Cardinal de\\' Medici to write the \"History of Florence,\" a task which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer observes that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play with.\"\\nWhen the \"History of Florence\" was finished, Machiavelli took it to Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\\' Medici, who had in the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Prince\" for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florence\" to the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.\\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten of Liberty and Peace.\" Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\\n\\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name, it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholy necromancer,\" which so long haunted men\\'s vision, has begun to fade.\\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII, overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to write the \"History of Florence,\" rather than employ him in the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"The Prince,\" its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\\'s contemporaries; yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and conduct.\\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"The Prince\" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon. Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be—and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses; prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to a higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to fight.\\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\\'s that government should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society; to this \"high argument\" \"The Prince\" contributes but little. Machiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests \"The Prince\" with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.\\nIn translating \"The Prince\" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. \"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\" In \"The Prince,\" it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare\\'s time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example: the word \"intrattenere,\" employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \"entertain,\" and every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power.\" But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians,\" etc., using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\\'s meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\\nPrincipal works.

In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.\\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in \\'84, nor those of Pope Julius in \\'10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III — CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.\\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.\\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico\\'s own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\\n     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\\n     Sforza, who married Beatrice d\\'Este. He ruled over Milan\\n     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.\\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.\\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority. Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\\n     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\\n     \"intrattenere.\"\\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.\\n     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"\\n     born 1462, died 1515.\\n\\n     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.\\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.\\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.\\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage.\\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\\n     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\\n     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\\n     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\\n     crown.\\n\\n     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\\'Amboise,\\n     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV — WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\\n\\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.\\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.\\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.\\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V — CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\\n\\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.\\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines.\\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE\\'S OWN ARMS AND ABILITY\\n\\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties. Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.\\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by force.\\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\\n     (*) Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\\n\\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.\\n     (*) \"Le radici e corrispondenze,\" their roots (i.e.\\n     foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other\\n     states—a common meaning of \"correspondence\" and\\n     \"correspondency\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.\\n     (*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married\\n     Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo\\n     Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his\\n     own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited\\n     agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-\\n     1507) during the transactions which led up to the\\n     assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and\\n     along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left\\n     an account, written ten years before \"The Prince,\" of the\\n     proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto\\n     dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,\"\\n     etc., a translation of which is appended to the present\\n     work.\\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.\\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\\n     (*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d\\'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.\\n     (*) Ramiro d\\'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.\\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+) was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\\n     (*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\\n\\n     (+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San\\n     Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.\\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\\n     (*) San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio\\n     Sforza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII — CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\\n\\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other modern—and without entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\\n     (*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.\\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one\\'s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\\n     (*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the\\n     modern equivalent of Machiavelli\\'s thought when he speaks of\\n     \"crudelta\" than the more obvious \"cruelties.\"\\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX — CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\\n\\nBut coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.\\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him.\\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them. But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\\nNabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on the people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged—such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.\\n     (*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under\\n     Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\\n\\n     (+) Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in\\n     Machiavelli\\'s \"Florentine History,\" Book III.\\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED\\n\\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country. And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his people.\\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year\\'s eating, drinking, and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and defend them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI — CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live. These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly—yet now a king of France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\\n     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.\\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander\\'s time. Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\\n     (*) Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\\' Medici.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII — HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\\n\\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them.\\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.\\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.\\n     (*) \"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\" This is one of the\\n     bons mots of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with\\n     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only\\n     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the\\n     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. \"The\\n     History of Henry VII,\" by Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had\\n     conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind\\n     of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of\\n     Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope\\n     Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into\\n     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,\\n     rather than with swords to fight.\"\\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.\\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed and quite free.\\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains. After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.\\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,(*) allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of Pitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\\n     (*) Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\\n\\n     (+) Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of\\n     Naples.\\n\\n     (%) Giovanni Acuto.

You must understand that the empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.\\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.\\n     (*) Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio\\n     in Romagna. He was the leader of the famous \"Company of St\\n     George,\" composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in\\n     1409.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII — CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE\\'S OWN\\n\\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,(*) for his assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.\\n     (*) Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of\\n     Naples), surnamed \"The Catholic,\" born 1452, died 1516.\\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles.\\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,(*) to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels.\\n     (*) Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.\\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.\\nCharles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one\\'s own forces. And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.\\n     (*) Charles VII of France, surnamed \"The Victorious,\" born\\n     1403, died 1461.\\n\\n     (+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.\\n     (*) \"Many speakers to the House the other night in the\\n     debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most\\n     lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the\\n     British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr Balfour\\n     replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under\\n     the weight of its military obligations, he said that this\\n     was \\'wholly unhistorical.\\' He might well have added that the\\n     Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen\\n     acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that\\n     it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer\\n     recognized.\"—Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.\\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength. And one\\'s own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And the way to make ready one\\'s own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV — THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\\n\\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.\\nPhilopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\\n     (*) Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks,\" born 252 B.C.,\\n     died 183 B.C.\\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV — CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED\\n\\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity. Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI — CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\\n\\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.\\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects\\' or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects\\' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.\\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII — CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\\n\\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\\n     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and\\n     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:\\n     \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\\n     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)\\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\\n     (*) . . . against my will, my fate\\n     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,\\n     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow\\'rs,\\n     And guard with these severities my shores.\\n\\n     Christopher Pitt.\\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.\\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.\\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII(*) — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\\n\\n     (*) \"The present chapter has given greater offence than any\\n     other portion of Machiavelli\\'s writings.\" Burd, \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 297.\\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\\n     (*) \"Contesting,\" i.e. \"striving for mastery.\" Mr Burd\\n     points out that this passage is imitated directly from\\n     Cicero\\'s \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,\\n     unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud\\n     proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad\\n     posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\"\\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind.\\n     (*) \"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad\\n     votum).\" The words \"ad votum\" are omitted in the Testina\\n     addition, 1550.\\n\\n     Alexander never did what he said,\\n     Cesare never said what he did.\\n\\n     Italian Proverb.\\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*) friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\\n     (*) \"Contrary to fidelity\" or \"faith,\" \"contro alla fede,\"\\n     and \"tutto fede,\" \"altogether faithful,\" in the next\\n     paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro\\n     alla fede\" and \"tutto fede,\" were omitted in the Testina\\n     edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal\\n     authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word\\n     \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as\\n     rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\" Observe that the\\n     word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the\\n     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of\\n     belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably\\n     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his\\n     Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as\\n     follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\\n     Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his\\n     political scheme: \\'That the show of religion was helpful to\\n     the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and\\n     pernicious.\\'\"\\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.\\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.\\nOne prince(*) of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.\\n     (*) Ferdinand of Aragon. \"When Machiavelli was writing \\'The\\n     Prince\\' it would have been clearly impossible to mention\\n     Ferdinand\\'s name here without giving offence.\" Burd\\'s \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 308.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX — THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\\n\\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.\\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.\\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.\\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\\n     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan\\n     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\\'s\\n     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from\\n     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had\\n     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the\\n     Boscoli conspiracy.\\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.\\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.\\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.\\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself—it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles—you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.\\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.\\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.\\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\\'s ruin.\\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.\\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.\\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX — ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\\n\\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.\\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.\\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\\n     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and\\n     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the\\n     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.\\n     A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the\\n     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote\\n     Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when. They\\n     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine\\n     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me\\n     at once.\" Cf. \"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini,\\n     translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI — HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\\n\\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him. Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.\\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.\\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.\\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state.\\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\\n     (*) \"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\" \"Arti\" were\\n     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: \"Arte . . . a whole\\n     company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\" The\\n     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr\\n     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\\n     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\\n     \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace\\'s\\n     \"Russia,\" ed. 1905: \"The sons . . . were always during the\\n     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger\\n     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind—\\n     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and\\n     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual\\n     members.\" The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity,\\n     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or\\n     \"arte.\" Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind\\n     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only\\n     another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental\\n     company.\" In both words the underlying idea is that of a\\n     body of men united by an oath. \"Tribu\" were possibly gentile\\n     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals\\n     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\"\\n     would be most appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII — CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\\n\\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.\\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII — HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\\n\\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, respect for you abates.\\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt.\\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything. This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\\n     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the\\n     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of\\n     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus\\n     became involved in Italian politics.\\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.\\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him.\\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV — WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\\n\\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.\\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years\\' possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV — WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\\n\\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\\n     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older\\n     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty\\n     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this\\n     miserable universe.\" Sorel\\'s \"Eastern Question.\"\\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.\\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.\\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.\\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.\\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI — AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\\n\\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\\n     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\\n     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\\n     title of Clement VII.\\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.\\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.\\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head. Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour.\\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince.\\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears. What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him? What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch:\\n     Virtu contro al Furore\\n     Prendera l\\'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\\n     Che l\\'antico valore\\n     Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\\n\\n     Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,\\n     And it i\\' th\\' combat soon shall put to flight:\\n     For the old Roman valour is not dead,\\n     Nor in th\\' Italians\\' brests extinguished.\\n\\n     Edward Dacre, 1640.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\\n\\nBY\\n\\nNICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.\\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.\\nThus it arose that, men\\'s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody\\'s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.\\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.\\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.\\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends. But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d\\'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke\\'s quarters, where they should be seized.\\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.\\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.\\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\\'s quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.\\nBut the duke\\'s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\\n\\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\\n\\n\\n\\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\\n\\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.\\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.\\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son\\'s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.\\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\\'s men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\\'s troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.\\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people\\'s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor\\'s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.\\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.\\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.\\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\" Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"\\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio\\'s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines\\' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.\\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy\\'s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio\\'s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio\\'s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.\\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\\'s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\\'s army. But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:\\n\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\"\\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\" answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less to me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the same.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not taken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and being told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesar died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.\" Having been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.\" He used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?\" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\" Castruccio answered: \"A helmet.\" Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\" On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\" Seeing on of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I pray God that you will let him feed you also.\" Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house from the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\" Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\" He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?\" asked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?\"\\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince, by Nicolo Machiavelli\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1232-h.htm or 1232-h.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/3/1232/\\n\\nProduced by John Bickers, David Widger and Others\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

       "  'Title: Pride and Prejudice\\nAuthor: Jane Austen\\n\\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE:\\n\\nA NOVEL.\\n\\nIN THREE VOLUMES.\\n\\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.\"\\n\\nVOL. I.\\n\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\\n\\n\"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"What is his name?\"\\n\\n\"Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"Is he married or single?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\n\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,\\n\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\\n\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.\"\\n\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\\'s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times them ill.\"\\n\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\n\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\n\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?\"\\n\\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.\"\\n\\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr. Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\\n\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,\" said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls,\" said she, when the door was shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart were entertained.\\n\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\"\\n\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Bingley, \"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\n\\n\"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, \"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife\\'s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger——\"\\n\\n\"If he had had any compassion for me,\" cried her husband impatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown——\"\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.\\n\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\n\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.\"\\n\\n\"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.\"\\n\\n\"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one meets it every where. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of every body\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man\\'s sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.—Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.—Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\\'s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him courteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n\"You began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \"You were Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n\\n\"Yes;—but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question—Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem as if——but however, it may all come to nothing you know.\"\\n\\n\"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,\" said Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure, Ma\\'am?—is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.—\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\\n\"Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with him, if I were you.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, Ma\\'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.\"\\n\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.\"\\n\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, \"is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly.\"\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet\\'s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them, was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother\\'s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.\"\\n\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\n\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\n\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\n\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\\n\\n\"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\n\\n\"With great energy;—but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.\"\\n\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\n\\n\"It will be her turn soon to be teazed,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!—If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added, \"Very well; if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with—\\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\\'—and I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\\n\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!—There is nothing like dancing after all.—I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, Sir;—and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage can dance.\"\\n\\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully;\" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;—\"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n\"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?—Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.—You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.\" And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,\\n\\n\"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.—I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n\"He is indeed—but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\\n\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\n\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\n\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!—What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\"\\n\\n\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray when am I to wish you joy?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.\"\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\\' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\\n\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\"\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\n\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of any body\\'s children, it should not be of my own however.\"\\n\\n\"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\n\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.—When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his regimentals.\"\\n\\n\"Mama,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\\'s library.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\\n\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\n\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n\"My dear Friend,\\n\\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. Yours ever,\\n\\n\"Caroline Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.\"\\n\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\n\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\n\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?\"\\n\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\n\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s purpose will be answered.\"\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy,\\n\\n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.\\n\\n\"Yours, &c.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.\"\\n\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.—Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.\\n\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.—That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.—Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\\n\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.\"\\n\\n\"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.\"\\n\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\n\\n\"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\\n\"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said Bingley.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"—A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\n\\n\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.\\n\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into.\"\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.\\n\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left so small a collection of books.—What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many generations.\"\\n\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.\"\\n\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\n\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or rather taller.\"\\n\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\\n\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.\"\\n\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\\n\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.\"\\n\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\n\\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \"there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones\\'s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her daughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n\"Indeed I have, Sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\\n\"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.\"\\n\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\n\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.\"\\n\\nEvery body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\\n\"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.\"\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.\\n\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!—He has always something to say to every body.—That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman,\" said Bingley.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, yes;—but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see any body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle\\'s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.\"\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on fine eyes.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.\\n\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\\n\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!\"\\n\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you—but I always mend my own.\"\\n\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?—At present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.\"\\n\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her brother—\"because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables.—Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\"\\n\\n\"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\\n\"The indirect boast;—for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\n\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\n\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself.\"\\n\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.\"\\n\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\n\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.—\"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her—\\n\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.—And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.—Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.\\n\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"in running away without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,—\\n\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,\\n\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.—You are charmingly group\\'d, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye.\"\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\\'s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with Miss Bennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy\\'s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!—When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,\\n\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?—I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.\"\\n\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.\"\\n\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;—but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.—I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. \"What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning\"—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. \"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;—if the first, I should be completely in your way;—and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard any thing so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him—laugh at him.—Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"But upon my honour I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no—I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth—\"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.—But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;—\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.\"\\n\\n\"No\"—said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for.—It is I believe too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful.—My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.\"\\n\\n\"That is a failing indeed!\"—cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.—I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\\n\"And your defect is a propensity to hate every body.\"\\n\\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is wilfully to misunderstand them.\"\\n\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\"—cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.—\"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.\"\\n\\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.—Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.—Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.—But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\"\\n\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\"\\n\\n\"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger.\" Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.—\"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure. Why Jane—you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.—But—good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment.\"\\n\\n\"It is not Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained. \"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.\"\\n\\nHunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\n15th October.\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\nThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—\"There, Mrs. Bennet.\"—My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\\'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\n\\nWilliam Collins.\"\\n\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\\n\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.\"\\n\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.—Can he be a sensible man, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\\n\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"his letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\\n\\n\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.\"\\n\\n\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,—and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted——\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\'s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets up stairs.\\n\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\\n\\n\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?\"\\n\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.\"\\n\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.—These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.\"\\n\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.—Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.—Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,\\n\\n\"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,\\n\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess;—for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father\\'s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.—Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour\\'s tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.—\"As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession;—her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it?—It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips\\'s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips\\' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.\\n\\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\\'s shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant\\'s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips\\'s manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\n\\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n\"I know little of the game, at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life——\" Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Wickham;—\"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself—for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.—Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,—\"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no right to give my opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.—Here you are in your own family.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\\n\\n\"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\\n\"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.\"\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\\n\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could that be?—How could his will be disregarded?—Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\\n\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\\n\"This is quite shocking!—He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\\n\"Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?—what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.\"\\n\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him—I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"I can hardly be just to him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!\"—She could have added, \"A young man too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"—but she contented herself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\n\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendance, and when immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of affection to myself.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!—I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!—If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,—for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\\n\"It is wonderful,\"—replied Wickham,—\"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;—and pride has often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\n\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,—to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.—\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,—very, very proud.—As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her father\\'s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\"\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,\\n\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?—Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\n\\n\"Probably not;—but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,—allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.—The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.\\n\\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,—and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.—I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\"\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips\\'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;—she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.—The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\n\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, indeed;—and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?—Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\"\\n\\n\"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s favourite in such a manner,—one, whom his father had promised to provide for.—It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no.\"\\n\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.—If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\n\\n\"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing.—One does not know what to think.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon;—one knows exactly what to think.\"\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,—that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy\\'s looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.\\n\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough.—I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\n\\n\"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,—a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:—and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help for it however. Mr. Wickham\\'s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\\'s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.—It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\n\\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.—Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.\\n\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Heaven forbid!—That would be the greatest misfortune of all!—To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!—Do not wish me such an evil.\"\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\\' looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\\n\\n\"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.—I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.\\n\\n\"Very well.—That reply will do for the present.—Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.—But now we may be silent.\"\\n\\n\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.—We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\" said he. \"How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.—You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.\"\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,\\n\\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.\"\\n\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,\" replied Elizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.\\n\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, Sir.—You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,\\n\\n\"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.—We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\\n\"Books—Oh! no.—I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.—We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\\n\"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.\"\\n\\n\"The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?\" said he, with a look of doubt.\\n\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\\n\"Merely to the illustration of your character,\" said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.\\n\\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,\\n\\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!—Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. \"Excuse my interference.—It was kindly meant.\"\\n\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.—\"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.—Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley\\'s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.\"\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley\\'s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\n\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!—I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'night.\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.—Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"—It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley\\'s two sisters. Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.—It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower.—What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?—You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.\"\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\n\\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary\\'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.—Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\n\\n\"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.—Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.—I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do.—In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.—Many stared.—Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\\'s conversation to herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy\\'s farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\\n\\n\"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\"\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,\\n\\n\"Oh dear!—Yes—certainly.—I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection.—Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\" And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,\\n\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am, do not go.—I beg you will not go.—Mr. Collins must excuse me.—He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am going away myself.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.—I desire you will stay where you are.\"—And upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, \"Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:\\n\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s foot-stool, that she said, \\'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.—Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.\"\\n\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.—You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so.—Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\n\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins very gravely—\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,\\n\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.\"\\n\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these:—It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\n\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.\"\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;—she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.\\n\\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.\\n\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had finished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?—It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.\\n\\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was. \"Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\\n\"I have, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.—Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.\"\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;—and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!—What do you think has happened this morning?—Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\n\\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.—But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.—I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you.—I have done with you from this very day.—I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.—Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!—But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\\n\\n\"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation.—\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"—\\n\\n\"My dear Madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,\" he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter\\'s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt\\'s, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.—To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;—that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\\n\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\"\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?—Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\n\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you—\\n\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this winter.\"\\n\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should.\"\\n\\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.—He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.\" \"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\"\\n\\n\"What think you of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"—said Jane as she finished it. \"Is it not clear enough?—Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.—Will you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.—No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.\"\\n\\n\"That is right.—You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?\"\\n\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"How can you talk so?\"—said Jane faintly smiling,—\"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\n\\n\"I did not think you would;—and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.\"\\n\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;—its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband.—Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n\"My dear Madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,\\n\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my good sir?—You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.\"\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\n\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her\\'s, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\\n\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,—impossible!\"\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,\\n\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?—Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\n\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,—\"you must be surprised, very much surprised,—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\"\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"—and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!—And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?—Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease her.—Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.—It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.—She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued absence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth\\'s; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane\\'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.\"\\n\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\n\\n\"I should not mind any thing at all.\"\\n\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\"\\n\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail. How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\\'s own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!—Why should he have it more than anybody else?\"\\n\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\nEND OF VOL.

EGERTON,\\nMILITARY LIBRARY, WHITEHALL.\\n1813.\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\\'s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister\\'s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,\\n\\n\"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.\\n\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time therefore.—I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\\'s respectability, and Charlotte\\'s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body\\'s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.\"\\n\\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied Jane, \"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.\"\\n\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to design,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\n\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\\n\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.\"\\n\\n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother\\'s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\\'s best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day, \"your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\n\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.\"\\n\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\n\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour\\'s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\n\\n\"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with the sister? She will not be able to help calling.\"\\n\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\n\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy\\'s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman\\'s reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\\n\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is—you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\\n\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\"\\n\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it.—Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!—My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your Mother of inviting him.\"\\n\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; \"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied.\"\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she \"wished they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,\\n\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"That you certainly shall.\"\\n\\n\"And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?\"\\n\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.\\n\\n\"My father and Maria are to come to me in March,\" added Charlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them.\"\\n\\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\\'s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.\\n\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street.\"\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall soon see them here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.\\n\\n\"Your\\'s, &c.\"\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as, by Wickham\\'s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:—\"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\\'s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of every body—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\\'s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n\"But, my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\\n\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather\\'s death made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No—why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?\"\\n\\n\"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.\"\\n\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?\"\\n\\n\"Her not objecting, does not justify him. It only shews her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n\"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"but perhaps to the Lakes.\"\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \"My dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin\\'s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband\\'s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has several.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\\n\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!\"\\n\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!\"\\n\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.\"\\n\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She looks sickly and cross.—Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!\"\\n\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\n\\nScarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.—Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James\\'s.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.—Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.—Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.—Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her\\'s, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.—Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\\'s astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.—He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her\\'s, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother\\'s maiden name?—Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.—Lady Catherine then observed,\\n\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.—It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.—Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day.—Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\n\\n\"One of them does.\"\\n\\n\"Why did not you all learn?—You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your\\'s.—Do you draw?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\n\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\n\\n\"Not one.\"\\n\\n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\n\\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!—I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.\\n\\n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected.\"\\n\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe\\'s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you have given me a treasure.\\' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Ma\\'am, all.\"\\n\\n\"All!—What, all five out at once? Very odd!—And you only the second.—The younger ones out before the elder are married!—Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, Ma\\'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.—The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive!—I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her Ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.—Pray, what is your age?\"\\n\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth smiling, \"your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,—therefore you need not conceal your age.\"\\n\\n\"I am not one and twenty.\"\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins\\'s side, and as many bows on Sir William\\'s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship\\'s praise into his own hands.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nSir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses\\' reach. This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord —— and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,\\n\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment\\'s pause, added,\\n\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?\"\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,\\n\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\\n\\n\"We are speaking of music, Madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.\\n\\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s proficiency.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, Madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs. Jenkinson\\'s room. She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in that part of the house.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill breeding, and made no answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\\n\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not say that you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\n\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n\\n\"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you—but so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.\"\\n\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\"\\n\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\\'s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,\\n\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly so—I thank you.\"\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer—and, after a short pause, added,\\n\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\"\\n\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.\"\\n\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n\\n\"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.\"\\n\\n\"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\\'s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\n\\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.\"\\n\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\\n\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,\\n\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of this!\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. \"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.\"\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.—She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.—She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.—How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!—Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane\\'s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,\\n\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n\\n\"I have been making the tour of the Park,\" he replied, \"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\"\\n\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.\\n\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\n\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?\"\\n\\n\"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\\n\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\"\\n\\n\"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\"\\n\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl\\'s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,\\n\\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n\\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man—he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily—\"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n\\n\"Care of him!—Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\n\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?\"\\n\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.\"\\n\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam smiling. \"He only told me, what I have now told you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\\n\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.\" \"But,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.\"\\n\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is lessening the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.\\n\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather displeased by her staying at home.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,\\n\\n\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,\\n\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\\n\\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\\n\\n\"I might as well enquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.\\n\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, \"I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?\"\\n\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?\"\\n\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\n\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, \"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.\"\\n\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\\n\\n\"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.\\n\\n\"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n\\nThe tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\\n\\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\"—And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.—The envelope itself was likewise full.—Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—\\n\\n\"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.\\n\\n\"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,—and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.—Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.—But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.—If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your\\'s, I can only say that I am sorry.—The necessity must be obeyed—and farther apology would be absurd.—I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.—But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.—I had often seen him in love before.—At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental information, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.—Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.—If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.—If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.—That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,—but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.—I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;—I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.—My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.—But there were other causes of repugnance;—causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.—These causes must be stated, though briefly.—The situation of your mother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.—Pardon me.—It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.—I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.—He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.—The part which I acted, is now to be explained.—His sisters\\' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.—We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.—I described, and enforced them earnestly.—But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister\\'s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.—But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.—To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.—I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.—That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;—but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.—Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.—It is done, however, and it was done for the best.—On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education. My father was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister\\'s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\\'s chief object was unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n\"Fitzwilliam Darcy.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips\\'s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling. That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.—Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\n\\n\"How despicably have I acted!\" she cried.—\"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!—I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.—How humiliating is this discovery!—Yet, how just a humiliation!—Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.—Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.\"\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s explanation there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.—How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?—He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment;—and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had always been.—Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.—She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;—and as she considered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.—Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. She could think only of her letter.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been. \"What would she have said?—how would she have behaved?\" were questions with which she amused herself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.—\"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!—They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,\\n\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\" replied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.—I must be in town next Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"But my father cannot.—He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.—Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\n\\n\"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.—Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.—Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.—I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.\"\\n\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!—Your uncle!—He keeps a man-servant, does he?—I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?—Oh! Bromley, of course.—If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham\\'s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,\\n\\n\"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!—it was melancholy to leave her to such society!—But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\\n\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection;—the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, \"it seems but a day or two since we first came!—and yet how many things have happened!\"\\n\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\n\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!—How much I shall have to tell!\"\\n\\nElizabeth privately added, \"And how much I shall have to conceal.\"\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of —— in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, \"Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\n\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia; \"but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\" Then shewing her purchases: \"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.\"\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Are they indeed?\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat down to table. \"What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,\\n\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King. There\\'s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\\n\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\n\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her. Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n\"How nicely we are crammed in!\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can\\'t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\\'s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,—only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\n\\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.\\n\\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!\"\\n\\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me. I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her, of the regiment\\'s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s refusal must have given him.\\n\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,\" said she; \"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n\\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.\"\\n\\n\"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n\\n\"But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.\"\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.\\n\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth. \"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy\\'s, but you shall do as you chuse.\"\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\\'s genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\n\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little and then replied, \"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?\"\\n\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister\\'s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane\\'s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother soon afterwards, \"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n\\n\"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!\" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar\\'s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall break mine,\" said Lydia.\\n\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.\"\\n\\n\"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,\" added Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate two.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,\" said she, \"though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,\\n\\n\"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Already arisen!\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia\\'s folly.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character. Excuse me—for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia\\'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\n\\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia\\'s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia\\'s leaving home.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and Mr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, \"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And pray may I ask?\" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.\"\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,\\n\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\n\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,\\n\\n\"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father\\'s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;—and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?\" said her aunt. \"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.\"\\n\\nElizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.\\n\\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\\n\\n\\nMATLOCK\\n\\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE:\\n\\nA NOVEL.\\n\\nIN THREE VOLUMES.\\n\\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.\"\\n\\nVOL.

EGERTON,\\nMILITARY LIBRARY, WHITEHALL.\\n1813.\\n\\n\\nDOVE-DALE\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;—and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.—But no,\"—recollecting herself,—\"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret.\\n\\nShe longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, \"but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.—\"He is now gone into the army,\" she added, \"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.\\n\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, \"is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds\\'s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said—\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.\"\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\\n\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mr. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\n\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.\"\\n\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,\\n\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world.\"\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.—\"Can this be Mr. Darcy!\" thought she.\\n\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Yes, Ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\n\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt, as they walked, \"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.\\n\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she should enter the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added.—\"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.\"\\n\\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father\\'s life time.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s happiness were in his guardianship!—How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!—How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing\\'s Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion.\"\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband\\'s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.\\n\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you,—Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected. \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\\n\\n\"There is something a little stately in him to be sure,\" replied her aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\n\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?\"\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.\\n\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\"\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\\'s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\\'s civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply, he added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant\\'s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude.—Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go.—Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana\\'s reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;—a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\\n\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.\"\\n\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\\'s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried; \"I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,—no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,\\n\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \\'She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.\\' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but that was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!—Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!—But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?—Impossible. I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle\\'s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\\n\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough;—you cannot go yourself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?—A glass of wine;—shall I get you one?—You are very ill.\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you;\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length, she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My youngest sister has left all her friends—has eloped;—has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.\"\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added, in a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!—I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now.\"\\n\\n\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved—shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!—They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\\'s immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.\\n\\n\"When my eyes were opened to his real character.—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.—But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.—I know it cannot be long.\"\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy—again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.—Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant\\'s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;—but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.—Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.—Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;—was it so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.\"\\n\\n\"That is all settled;\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\n\\nBut wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\n\\n\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?\"\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\"\\n\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n\"I do, indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.\"\\n\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\\'s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other.\"\\n\\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\\'s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.\"\\n\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.\"\\n\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n\\n\"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n\\n\"And my mother—How is she? How are you all?\"\\n\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.\"\\n\\n\"But you—How are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you must have gone through!\"\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\\n\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he, \"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,—that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,\\n\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\n\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable—that one false step involves her in endless ruin—that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,—and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\n\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?\"\\n\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better;\" replied her sister. \"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\\n\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to his wife?\"\\n\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet,\\n\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to our good journey.\\n\\n\"Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n\"Lydia Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But at least it shews, that she was serious in the object of her journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\n\\n\"I never saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.—I hope there was.—But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.\"\\n\\n\"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\n\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.\"\\n\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\n\\nShe then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n\"He meant, I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\\'s family. Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street. That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect.\\n\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.\\n\\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ——shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning\\'s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:\\n\\n\"My dear Sir,\\n\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent\\'s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\\n\\n\"I am, dear Sir, &c. &c.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\" she cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!\" she cried. \"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\"\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\n\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\n\\n\"She is happy, then,\" said her father, drily; \"and her residence there will probably be of some duration.\"\\n\\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, \"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\\'s tea.\\n\\n\"This is a parade,\" cried he, \"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,—or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.\"\\n\\n\"I am not going to run away, Papa,\" said Kitty, fretfully; \"if I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\n\\n\"You go to Brighton!—I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\"\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\"\\n\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.\"\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;—their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,\\n\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking towards the little copse.\"\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,\\n\\n\"Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?\"\\n\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; \"but perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what it is about.\"\\n\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Monday,\\nAugust 2.\\n\\n\"My dear Brother,\\n\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both——\"\\n\\n\"Then it is, as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\n\\nElizabeth read on; \"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on. Your\\'s, &c.\\n\\n\"Edw. Gardiner.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible!\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \"Can it be possible that he will marry her?\"\\n\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;\" said her sister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back, and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.\"\\n\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n\"And may I ask?\" said Elizabeth, \"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\"\\n\\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\n\\n\"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know:—one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.\"\\n\\n\"Money! my uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, Sir?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said her father, \"Wickham\\'s a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\n\\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \"How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!\"\\n\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\n\\n\"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\" said Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\n\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\" said Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\"\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,\\n\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\n\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\n\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried: \"This is delightful indeed!—She will be married!—I shall see her again!—She will be married at sixteen!—My good, kind brother!—I knew how it would be—I knew he would manage every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia!—How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy. In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\\'s delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.\\n\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\n\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expences had been very little within that sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.\\n\\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\n\\n\"Haye-Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\\'s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\\'s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.\\n\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s. It is Mr. Wickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.—Your\\'s, &c.\\n\\n\"E. Gardiner.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\\'s removal from the ——shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——\\'s regiment.\"\\n\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nTheir sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\n\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.\"\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham,\" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\\n\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\n\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\\'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\\n\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\\n\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\\'s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\\n\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\n\\n\"Not that I shall though,\" she added to herself, as she finished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\n\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\n\\n\"My dear niece,\\n\\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\\'s flight, on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\n\\n\"M. Gardiner.\"\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt\\'s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he, as he joined her.\\n\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better.\"\\n\\n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\n\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n\\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n\\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.\"\\n\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,\\n\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! I don\\'t know. Not these two or three years perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\\'s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with one\\'s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n\\n\"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\"\\n\\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.\\n\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news.) \"Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher\\'s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\\n\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\n\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself.\"\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you will wait on him of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\'s errand again.\"\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\"\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near,\\n\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\n\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what\\'s his name. That tall, proud man.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\\n\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early enough for expectation.\"\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\n\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\n\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \\'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing. It was my brother Gardiner\\'s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.\\n\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\n\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\\'s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\\n\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\" said she, \"did he come at all?\"\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him.\"\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly. \"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now.\"\\n\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.\"\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother\\'s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for ever.\"\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\n\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?\"\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\n\\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\n\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.\"\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas\\'s last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? \\'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\"\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man.\"\\n\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\n\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\n\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come.—He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\n\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?\"\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\\n\\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give into it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,\\n\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s concurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s schemes.\\n\\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not every body as happy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.\\n\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious circumspection! of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say.\"\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,\\n\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.\\n\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in me.\"\\n\\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha\\'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.\"\\n\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for it?\"\\n\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\n\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!\"\\n\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.\"\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!\"\\n\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine. \"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.\\n\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,\\n\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\n\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\n\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in her face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—\\n\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\n\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth, coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\n\\n\"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions, which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n\\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.\"\\n\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\n\\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\n\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.\"\\n\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\n\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?\\n\\n\"Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\n\\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up.\"\\n\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s daughter; so far we are equal.\"\\n\\n\"True. You are a gentleman\\'s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\n\\n\"I am not.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require.\"\\n\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\\'s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man\\'s marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew\\'s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father\\'s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully answered. \"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.\"\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.\"\\n\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n\\n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n\\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.\"\\n\\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.\"\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\\n\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set that down, as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,\\n\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest.\"\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,\\n\\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?\"\\n\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. \"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.\"\\n\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\" \"This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.\"\\n\\n\"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\n\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\\n\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\" \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\" \"That is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be Missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!\"\\n\\n\"Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\\'s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your\\'s. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\n\\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.\"\\n\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\"\\n\\nElizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\n\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \\'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.\\' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.\"\\n\\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?\"\\n\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\n\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\n\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only child) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?\"\\n\\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.\"\\n\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.\"\\n\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.\"\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\\n\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.\\n\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.\\n\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he \"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.\\n\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n\\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.\"\\n\\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.\"\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.\"\\n\\n\"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried Jane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n\\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest sister, now be be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\n\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\n\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.\\n\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia\\'s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\n\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?\"\\n\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\n\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father\\'s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?\"\\n\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my indifference?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane\\'s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! \\'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\n\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could you begin?\" said she. \"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\n\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?\"\\n\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\n\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\"\\n\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\n\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\\n\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\n\\n\"And so was I.\"\\n\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do.\"\\n\\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your\\'s. My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\\n\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?\"\\n\\n\"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.\"\\n\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\"\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter, but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\n\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\n\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\n\\n\"Dear Sir,\\n\\n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\\n\\n\"Your\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Philips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy,\\n\\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n\\n\"Yours, &c.\"\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.\\n\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\\'s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n'],\n",

Where is the Opposition\\nthat has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism,\\nagainst the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against\\nits reactionary adversaries?\\n\\nTwo things result from this fact.\\n\\nI.  Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers\\nto be itself a Power.\\n\\nII.  It is high time that Communists should openly, in the\\nface of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their\\ntendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of\\nCommunism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\\n\\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have\\nassembled in London, and sketched the following Manifesto, to be\\npublished in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and\\nDanish languages.\\n\\n\\n\\nI.  BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS\\n\\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history\\nof class struggles.\\n\\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf,\\nguild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed,\\nstood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an\\nuninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time\\nended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at\\nlarge, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\\n\\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a\\ncomplicated arrangement of society into various orders, a\\nmanifold gradation of social rank.  In ancient Rome we have\\npatricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages,\\nfeudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices,\\nserfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate\\ngradations.\\n\\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins\\nof feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms.  It\\nhas but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,\\nnew forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  Our epoch, the\\nepoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive\\nfeature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a\\nwhole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps,\\ninto two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie\\nand Proletariat.\\n\\nFrom the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers\\nof the earliest towns.  From these burgesses the first elements\\nof the bourgeoisie were developed.\\n\\nThe discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up\\nfresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and\\nChinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with\\nthe colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in\\ncommodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to\\nindustry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the\\nrevolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nThe feudal system of industry, under which industrial production\\nwas monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the\\ngrowing wants of the new markets.  The manufacturing system took\\nits place.  The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the\\nmanufacturing middle class; division of labour between the\\ndifferent corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of\\nlabour in each single workshop.\\n\\nMeantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising.\\nEven manufacture no longer sufficed.  Thereupon, steam and\\nmachinery revolutionised industrial production.  The place of\\nmanufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of\\nthe industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the\\nleaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.\\n\\nModern industry has established the world-market, for which the\\ndiscovery of America paved the way.  This market has given an\\nimmense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication\\nby land.  This development has, in its time, reacted on the\\nextension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce,\\nnavigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the\\nbourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the\\nbackground  every class handed down from the Middle Ages.\\n\\nWe see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the\\nproduct of a long course of development, of a series of\\nrevolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.\\n\\nEach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied\\nby a corresponding political advance of that class.  An\\noppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an\\narmed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune;\\nhere independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany),\\nthere taxable \"third estate\" of the monarchy (as in France),\\nafterwards, in the  period of manufacture proper, serving either\\nthe semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise\\nagainst the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the great\\nmonarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the\\nestablishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market,\\nconquered for itself, in the modern representative State,\\nexclusive political sway.  The executive of the modern State is\\nbut a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary\\npart.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an\\nend to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  It has\\npitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to\\nhis \"natural superiors,\" and has left remaining no other nexus\\nbetween man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash\\npayment.\"  It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of\\nreligious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine\\nsentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.  It\\nhas resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of\\nthe numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that\\nsingle, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.  In one word, for\\nexploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked,\\nshameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation\\nhitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.  It has\\nconverted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the\\nman of science, into its paid wage labourers.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental\\nveil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money\\nrelation.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the\\nbrutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists\\nso much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful\\nindolence.  It has been the first to show what man\\'s activity can\\nbring about.  It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian\\npyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has\\nconducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses\\nof nations and crusades.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising\\nthe instruments of production, and thereby the relations of\\nproduction, and with them the whole relations of society.\\nConservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form,\\nwas, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all\\nearlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of\\nproduction, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions,\\neverlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois\\nepoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations,\\nwith their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and\\nopinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated\\nbefore they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all\\nthat is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face\\nwith sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his\\nrelations with his kind.\\n\\nThe need of a constantly expanding market for its products\\nchases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It\\nmust nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions\\neverywhere.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market\\ngiven a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in\\nevery country.  To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has\\ndrawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on\\nwhich it stood.  All old-established national industries have\\nbeen destroyed or are daily being destroyed.  They are dislodged\\nby new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death\\nquestion for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer\\nwork up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the\\nremotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only\\nat home, but in every quarter of the globe.  In place of the old\\nwants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new\\nwants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant\\nlands and climes.  In place of the old local and national\\nseclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every\\ndirection, universal inter-dependence of nations.  And as in\\nmaterial, so also in intellectual production.  The intellectual\\ncreations of individual nations become common property.  National\\none-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more\\nimpossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures,\\nthere arises a world literature.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of\\nproduction, by the immensely facilitated means of communication,\\ndraws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.\\nThe cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with\\nwhich it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the\\nbarbarians\\' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to\\ncapitulate.  It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to\\nadopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to\\nintroduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to\\nbecome bourgeois themselves.  In one word, it creates a world\\nafter its own image.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the\\ntowns.  It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the\\nurban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued\\na considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural\\nlife.  Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so\\nit has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on\\nthe civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois,\\nthe East on the West.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the\\nscattered state of the population, of the means of production,\\nand of property.  It has agglomerated production, and has\\nconcentrated property in a few hands.  The necessary consequence\\nof this was political centralisation.  Independent, or but\\nloosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws,\\ngovernments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into\\none nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national\\nclass-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.  The\\nbourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has\\ncreated more massive and more colossal productive forces than\\nhave all preceding generations together.  Subjection of Nature\\'s\\nforces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry\\nand agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs,\\nclearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of\\nrivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground--what\\nearlier century had even a presentiment that such productive\\nforces slumbered in the lap of social labour?\\n\\nWe see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose\\nfoundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in\\nfeudal society.  At a certain stage in the development of these\\nmeans of production and of exchange, the conditions under which\\nfeudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of\\nagriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal\\nrelations of property became no longer compatible with the\\nalready developed productive forces; they became so many fetters.\\nThey had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.\\n\\nInto their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a\\nsocial and political constitution adapted to it, and by the\\neconomical and political sway of the bourgeois class.\\n\\nA similar movement is going on before our own eyes.  Modern\\nbourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange\\nand of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic\\nmeans of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is\\nno longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he\\nhas called up by his spells.  For many a decade past the history\\nof industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of\\nmodern productive forces against modern conditions of production,\\nagainst the property relations that are the conditions for the\\nexistence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.  It is enough to\\nmention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put\\non its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the\\nentire bourgeois society.  In these crises a great part not only\\nof the existing products, but also of the previously created\\nproductive forces, are periodically destroyed.  In these crises\\nthere breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would\\nhave seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.\\nSociety suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary\\nbarbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of\\ndevastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;\\nindustry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  Because\\nthere is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence,\\ntoo much industry, too much commerce.  The productive forces at\\nthe disposal of society no longer tend to further the development\\nof the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they\\nhave become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are\\nfettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring\\ndisorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the\\nexistence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois\\nsociety are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.\\nAnd how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  On the one\\nhand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the\\nother, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough\\nexploitation of the old ones.  That is to say, by paving the\\nway for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by\\ndiminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.\\n\\nThe weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the\\nground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\\n\\nBut not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring\\ndeath to itself; it has also called into existence the men who\\nare to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the\\nproletarians.\\n\\nIn proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed,\\nin the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working\\nclass, developed--a class of labourers, who live only so long\\nas they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour\\nincreases capital.  These labourers, who must sell themselves\\npiece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of\\ncommerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of\\ncompetition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\\n\\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of\\nlabour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual\\ncharacter, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  He\\nbecomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most\\nsimple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is\\nrequired of him.  Hence, the cost of production of a workman is\\nrestricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he\\nrequires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his\\nrace.  But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of\\nlabour, is equal to its cost of production.  In proportion\\ntherefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage\\ndecreases.  Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and\\ndivision of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden\\nof toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working\\nhours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by\\nincreased speed of the machinery, etc.\\n\\nModern industry has converted the little workshop of the\\npatriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial\\ncapitalist.  Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are\\norganised like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they\\nare placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers\\nand sergeants.  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class,\\nand of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by\\nthe machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the\\nindividual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  The more openly this\\ndespotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty,\\nthe more hateful and the more embittering it is.\\n\\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual\\nlabour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes\\ndeveloped, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of\\nwomen. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive\\nsocial validity for the working class. All are instruments of\\nlabour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age\\nand sex.\\n\\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer,\\nso far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is\\nset upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord,\\nthe shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\\n\\nThe lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople,\\nshopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and\\npeasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly\\nbecause their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale\\non which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the\\ncompetition with the large capitalists, partly because their\\nspecialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of\\nproduction.  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes\\nof the population.\\n\\nThe proletariat goes through various stages of development.\\nWith its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  At\\nfirst the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by\\nthe workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade,\\nin one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly\\nexploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the\\nbourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments\\nof production themselves; they destroy imported wares that\\ncompete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they\\nset factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished\\nstatus of the workman of the Middle Ages.\\n\\nAt this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass\\nscattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual\\ncompetition.  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,\\nthis is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of\\nthe union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its\\nown political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in\\nmotion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so.  At this\\nstage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies,\\nbut the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute\\nmonarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty\\nbourgeoisie.  Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated\\nin the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a\\nvictory for the bourgeoisie.\\n\\nBut with the development of industry the proletariat not only\\nincreases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses,\\nits strength grows, and it feels that strength more.  The various\\ninterests and conditions of life within the ranks of the\\nproletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as\\nmachinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly\\neverywhere reduces wages to the same low level.  The growing\\ncompetition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial\\ncrises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.  The\\nunceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing,\\nmakes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions\\nbetween individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and\\nmore the character of collisions between two classes.  Thereupon\\nthe workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against\\nthe bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of\\nwages; they found permanent associations in order to make\\nprovision beforehand for these occasional revolts.  Here and\\nthere the contest breaks out into riots.\\n\\nNow and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.\\nThe real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate\\nresult, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.  This\\nunion is helped on by the improved means of communication that\\nare created by modern industry and that place the workers of\\ndifferent localities in contact with one another.  It was just\\nthis contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local\\nstruggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle\\nbetween classes.  But every class struggle is a political\\nstruggle.  And that union, to attain which the burghers of the\\nMiddle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries,\\nthe modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few\\nyears.\\n\\nThis organisation of the proletarians into a class, and\\nconsequently into a political party, is continually being upset\\nagain by the competition between the workers themselves.  But it\\never rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.  It compels\\nlegislative recognition of particular interests of the workers,\\nby taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie\\nitself.  Thus the ten-hours\\' bill in England was carried.\\n\\nAltogether collisions between the classes of the old society\\nfurther, in many ways, the course of development of the\\nproletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant\\nbattle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those\\nportions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become\\nantagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the\\nbourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees\\nitself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its\\nhelp, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The\\nbourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its\\nown instruments of political and general education, in other\\nwords, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting\\nthe bourgeoisie.\\n\\nFurther, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling\\nclasses are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the\\nproletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of\\nexistence.  These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements\\nof enlightenment and progress.\\n\\nFinally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive\\nhour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling\\nclass, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a\\nviolent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling\\nclass cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the\\nclass that holds the future in its hands.  Just as, therefore, at\\nan earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the\\nbourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the\\nproletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois\\nideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of\\ncomprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.\\n\\nOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie\\ntoday, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.\\nThe other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of\\nModern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential\\nproduct.  The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the\\nshopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the\\nbourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions\\nof the middle class.  They are therefore not revolutionary, but\\nconservative.  Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try\\nto roll back the wheel of history.  If by chance they are\\nrevolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending\\ntransfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their\\npresent, but their future interests, they desert their own\\nstandpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\\n\\nThe \"dangerous class,\" the social scum, that passively rotting\\nmass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may,\\nhere and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian\\nrevolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more\\nfor the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.\\n\\nIn the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at\\nlarge are already virtually swamped.  The proletarian is without\\nproperty; his relation to his wife and children has no longer\\nanything in common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern\\nindustrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in\\nEngland as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him\\nof every trace of national character.  Law, morality, religion,\\nare to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in\\nambush just as many bourgeois interests.\\n\\nAll the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to\\nfortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at\\nlarge to their conditions of appropriation.  The proletarians\\ncannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except\\nby abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and\\nthereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  They\\nhave nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission\\nis to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of,\\nindividual property.\\n\\nAll previous historical movements were movements of minorities,\\nor in the interests of minorities.  The proletarian movement is\\nthe self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority,\\nin the interests of the immense majority.  The proletariat, the\\nlowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise\\nitself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official\\nsociety being sprung into the air.\\n\\nThough not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the\\nproletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.\\nThe proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all\\nsettle matters with its own bourgeoisie.\\n\\nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the\\nproletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging\\nwithin existing society, up to the point where that war breaks\\nout into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the\\nbourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\\n\\nHitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have\\nalready seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed\\nclasses.  But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions\\nmust be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its\\nslavish existence.  The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised\\nhimself to membership in the commune, just as the petty\\nbourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to\\ndevelop into a bourgeois.  The modern laborer, on the contrary,\\ninstead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and\\ndeeper below the conditions of existence of his own class.  He\\nbecomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than\\npopulation and wealth.  And here it becomes evident, that the\\nbourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in\\nsociety, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society\\nas an over-riding law.  It is unfit to rule because it is\\nincompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his\\nslavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a\\nstate, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.\\nSociety can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other\\nwords, its existence is no longer compatible with society.\\n\\nThe essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of\\nthe bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of\\ncapital; the condition for capital is wage-labour.  Wage-labour\\nrests exclusively on competition between the laborers.  The\\nadvance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie,\\nreplaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition,\\nby their revolutionary combination, due to association.  The\\ndevelopment of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its\\nfeet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and\\nappropriates products.  What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces,\\nabove all, is its own grave-diggers.  Its fall and the victory of\\nthe proletariat are equally inevitable.\\n\\n\\n\\nII.  PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS\\n\\nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a\\nwhole?\\n\\nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other\\nworking-class parties.\\n\\nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of the\\nproletariat as a whole.\\n\\nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own,\\nby which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.\\n\\nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties\\nby this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians\\nof the different countries, they point out and bring to the front\\nthe common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of\\nall nationality.  (2) In the various stages of development which the\\nstruggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass\\nthrough, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the\\nmovement as a whole.\\n\\nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically,\\nthe most advanced and resolute section of the working-class\\nparties of every country, that section which pushes forward\\nall others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over\\nthe great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly\\nunderstanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate\\ngeneral results of the proletarian movement.\\n\\nThe immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all\\nthe other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into\\na class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of\\npolitical power by the proletariat.\\n\\nThe theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way\\nbased on ideas or principles that have been invented, or\\ndiscovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  They\\nmerely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from\\nan existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on\\nunder our very eyes.  The abolition of existing property\\nrelations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.\\n\\nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject\\nto historical change consequent upon the change in historical\\nconditions.\\n\\nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in\\nfavour of bourgeois property.\\n\\nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of\\nproperty generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But\\nmodern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete\\nexpression of the system of producing and appropriating products,\\nthat is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the\\nmany by the few.\\n\\nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in\\nthe single sentence: Abolition of private property.\\n\\nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing\\nthe right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a\\nman\\'s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork\\nof all personal freedom, activity and independence.\\n\\nHard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  Do you mean the\\nproperty of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of\\nproperty that preceded the bourgeois form?  There is no need to\\nabolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent\\nalready destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\\n\\nOr do you mean modern bourgeois private property?\\n\\nBut does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not\\na bit.  It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which\\nexploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon\\ncondition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh\\nexploitation.  Property, in its present form, is based on the\\nantagonism of capital and wage-labour.  Let us examine both sides\\nof this antagonism.\\n\\nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a\\nsocial status in production.  Capital is a collective product,\\nand only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last\\nresort, only by the united action of all members of society,\\ncan it be set in motion.\\n\\nCapital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into\\nthe property of all members of society, personal property is not\\nthereby transformed into social property. It is only the social\\ncharacter of the property that is changed. It loses its\\nclass-character.\\n\\nLet us now take wage-labour.\\n\\nThe average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,\\nthat quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely\\nrequisite in bare existence as a labourer.  What, therefore, the\\nwage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely\\nsuffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  We by no\\nmeans intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the\\nproducts of labour, an appropriation that is made for the\\nmaintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no\\nsurplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  All that we\\nwant to do away with, is the miserable character of this\\nappropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase\\ncapital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of\\nthe ruling class requires it.\\n\\nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase\\naccumulated labour.  In Communist society, accumulated labour\\nis but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence\\nof the labourer.\\n\\nIn bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present;\\nin Communist society, the present dominates the past.  In\\nbourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality,\\nwhile the living person is dependent and has no individuality.\\n\\nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the\\nbourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly\\nso. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois\\nindependence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.\\n\\nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of\\nproduction, free trade, free selling and buying.\\n\\nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying\\ndisappears also.  This talk about free selling and buying, and\\nall the other \"brave words\" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in\\ngeneral, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted\\nselling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages,\\nbut have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of\\nbuying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,\\nand of the bourgeoisie itself.\\n\\nYou are horrified at our intending to do away with private\\nproperty.  But in your existing society, private property is\\nalready done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its\\nexistence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the\\nhands of those nine-tenths.  You reproach us, therefore, with\\nintending to do away with a form of property, the necessary\\ncondition for whose existence is the non-existence of any\\nproperty for the immense majority of society.\\n\\nIn one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your\\nproperty.  Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\\n\\nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into\\ncapital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being\\nmonopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can\\nno longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital,\\nfrom that moment, you say individuality vanishes.\\n\\nYou must, therefore, confess that by \"individual\" you mean no\\nother person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of\\nproperty.  This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and\\nmade impossible.\\n\\nCommunism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the\\nproducts of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the\\npower to subjugate the labour of others by means of such\\nappropriation.\\n\\nIt has been objected that upon the abolition of private property\\nall work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.\\n\\nAccording to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone\\nto the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who\\nwork, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not\\nwork. The whole of this objection is but another expression of\\nthe tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when\\nthere is no longer any capital.\\n\\nAll objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing\\nand appropriating material products, have, in the same way,\\nbeen urged against the Communistic modes of producing and\\nappropriating intellectual products.  Just as, to the bourgeois,\\nthe disappearance of class property is the disappearance of\\nproduction itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to\\nhim identical with the disappearance of all culture.\\n\\nThat culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous\\nmajority, a mere training to act as a machine.\\n\\nBut don\\'t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended\\nabolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois\\nnotions of freedom, culture, law, etc.  Your very ideas are but\\nthe outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and\\nbourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of\\nyour class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential\\ncharacter and direction are determined by the economical\\nconditions of existence of your class.\\n\\nThe selfish misconception that induces you to transform into\\neternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms\\nspringing from your present mode of production and form of\\nproperty--historical relations that rise and disappear in the\\nprogress of production--this misconception you share with every\\nruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the\\ncase of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal\\nproperty, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of\\nyour own bourgeois form of property.\\n\\nAbolition of the family!  Even the most radical flare up at this\\ninfamous proposal of the Communists.\\n\\nOn what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family,\\nbased?  On capital, on private gain.  In its completely developed\\nform this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.  But this\\nstate of things finds its complement in the practical absence of\\nthe family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\\n\\nThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its\\ncomplement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of\\ncapital.\\n\\nDo you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of\\nchildren by their parents?  To this crime we plead guilty.\\n\\nBut, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations,\\nwhen we replace home education by social.\\n\\nAnd your education!  Is not that also social, and determined by the\\nsocial conditions under which you educate, by the intervention,\\ndirect or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.?  The\\nCommunists have not invented the intervention of society in\\neducation; they do but seek to alter the character of that\\nintervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the\\nruling class.\\n\\nThe bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about\\nthe hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the\\nmore disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all\\nfamily ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their\\nchildren transformed into simple articles of commerce and\\ninstruments of labour.\\n\\nBut you Communists would introduce community of women, screams\\nthe whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\\n\\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.\\nHe hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited\\nin common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than\\nthat the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the\\nwomen.\\n\\nHe has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away\\nwith the status of women as mere instruments of production.\\n\\nFor the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the\\nvirtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women\\nwhich, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established\\nby the Communists.  The Communists have no need to introduce\\ncommunity of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\\n\\nOur bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters\\nof their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common\\nprostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other\\'s\\nwives.\\n\\nBourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common\\nand thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly\\nbe reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in\\nsubstitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised\\ncommunity of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the\\nabolition of the present system of production must bring with it\\nthe abolition of the community of women springing from that\\nsystem, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\\n\\nThe Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish\\ncountries and nationality.\\n\\nThe working men have no country.  We cannot take from them what\\nthey have not got.  Since the proletariat must first of all\\nacquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of\\nthe nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far,\\nitself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\\n\\nNational differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily\\nmore and more vanishing, owing to the development of the\\nbourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to\\nuniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of\\nlife corresponding thereto.\\n\\nThe supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still\\nfaster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at\\nleast, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of\\nthe proletariat.\\n\\nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another\\nis put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will\\nalso be put an end to.  In proportion as the antagonism between\\nclasses within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation\\nto another will come to an end.\\n\\nThe charges against Communism made from a religious, a\\nphilosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint,\\nare not deserving of serious examination.\\n\\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man\\'s ideas,\\nviews and conceptions, in one word, man\\'s consciousness, changes\\nwith every change in the conditions of his material existence, in\\nhis social relations and in his social life?\\n\\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that\\nintellectual production changes its character in proportion as\\nmaterial production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age\\nhave ever been the ideas of its ruling class.\\n\\nWhen people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do\\nbut express the fact, that within the old society, the elements\\nof a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the\\nold ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old\\nconditions of existence.\\n\\nWhen the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient\\nreligions were overcome by Christianity.  When Christian ideas\\nsuccumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal\\nsociety fought its death battle with the then revolutionary\\nbourgeoisie.  The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of\\nconscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition\\nwithin the domain of knowledge.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" it will be said, \"religious, moral, philosophical\\nand juridical ideas have been modified in the course of\\nhistorical development.  But religion, morality philosophy,\\npolitical science, and law, constantly survived this change.\"\\n\\n\"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice,\\netc. that are common to all states of society. But Communism\\nabolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all\\nmorality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it\\ntherefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\"\\n\\nWhat does this accusation reduce itself to?  The history of\\nall past society has consisted in the development of class\\nantagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at\\ndifferent epochs.\\n\\nBut whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all\\npast ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the\\nother. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past\\nages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays,\\nmoves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which\\ncannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of\\nclass antagonisms.\\n\\nThe Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with\\ntraditional property relations; no wonder that its development\\ninvolves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\\n\\nBut let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\\n\\nWe have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the\\nworking class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of\\nruling as to win the battle of democracy.\\n\\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by\\ndegrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all\\ninstruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the\\nproletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the\\ntotal of productive forces as rapidly as possible.\\n\\nOf course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by\\nmeans of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on\\nthe conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,\\ntherefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable,\\nbut which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,\\nnecessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are\\nunavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of\\nproduction.\\n\\nThese measures will of course be different in different\\ncountries.\\n\\nNevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will\\nbe pretty generally applicable.\\n\\n1.  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents\\n    of land to public purposes.\\n\\n2.  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\\n\\n3.  Abolition of all right of inheritance.\\n\\n4.  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\\n\\n5.  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means\\n    of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive\\n    monopoly.\\n\\n6.  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport\\n    in the hands of the State.\\n\\n7.  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by\\n    the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and\\n    the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a\\n    common plan.\\n\\n8.  Equal liability of all to labour.  Establishment of\\n    industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\\n\\n9.  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;\\n    gradual abolition of the distinction between town and\\n    country, by a more equable distribution of the population\\n    over the country.\\n\\n10. Free education for all children in public schools.\\n    Abolition of children\\'s factory labour in its present form.\\n    Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.\\n\\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions have\\ndisappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the\\nhands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power\\nwill lose its political character.  Political power, properly so\\ncalled, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing\\nanother.  If the proletariat during its contest with the\\nbourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to\\norganise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it\\nmakes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force\\nthe old conditions of production, then it will, along with these\\nconditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of\\nclass antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have\\nabolished its own supremacy as a class.\\n\\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and\\nclass antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which\\nthe free development of each is the condition for the free\\ndevelopment of all.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.  SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE\\n\\n\\n1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM\\n\\n\\nA. Feudal Socialism\\n\\nOwing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the\\naristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against\\nmodern bourgeois society.  In the French revolution of July 1830,\\nand in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again\\nsuccumbed to the hateful upstart.  Thenceforth, a serious political\\ncontest was altogether out of the question.  A literary battle\\nalone remained possible.  But even in the domain of literature\\nthe old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.\\n\\nIn order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to\\nlose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate\\ntheir indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the\\nexploited working class alone.  Thus the aristocracy took their\\nrevenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering\\nin his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.\\n\\nIn this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half\\nlampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at\\ntimes, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the\\nbourgeoisie to the very heart\\'s core; but always ludicrous in\\nits effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of\\nmodern history.\\n\\nThe aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the\\nproletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  But the people, so\\noften as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal\\ncoats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.\\n\\nOne section of the French Legitimists and \"Young England\"\\nexhibited this spectacle.\\n\\nIn pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to\\nthat of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they\\nexploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite\\ndifferent, and that are now antiquated.  In showing that, under\\ntheir rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget\\nthat the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their\\nown form of society.\\n\\nFor the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary\\ncharacter of their criticism that their chief accusation against\\nthe bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime\\na class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and\\nbranch the old order of society.\\n\\nWhat they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it\\ncreates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary\\nproletariat.\\n\\nIn political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive\\nmeasures against the working class; and in ordinary life,\\ndespite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the\\ngolden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter\\ntruth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and\\npotato spirits.\\n\\nAs the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord,\\nso has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.\\n\\nNothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist\\ntinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property,\\nagainst marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the\\nplace of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification\\nof the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian\\nSocialism is but the holy, water with which the priest consecrates\\nthe heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\\n\\n\\nB. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\\n\\nThe feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by\\nthe bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence\\npined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society.\\nThe mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were\\nthe precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.  In those countries\\nwhich are but little developed, industrially and commercially,\\nthese two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\nIn countries where modern civilisation has become fully\\ndeveloped, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,\\nfluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing\\nitself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.  The\\nindividual members of this class, however, are being constantly\\nhurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition,\\nand, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment\\napproaching when they will completely disappear as an independent\\nsection of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures,\\nagriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.\\n\\nIn countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more\\nthan half of the population, it was natural that writers who\\nsided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,\\nin their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the\\npeasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these\\nintermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working\\nclass.  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.  Sismondi was the\\nhead of this school, not only in France but also in England.\\n\\nThis school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the\\ncontradictions in the conditions of modern production.  It laid\\nbare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  It proved,\\nincontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and\\ndivision of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a\\nfew hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the\\ninevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery\\nof the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying\\ninequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of\\nextermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral\\nbonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.\\n\\nIn its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires\\neither to restoring the old means of production and of exchange,\\nand with them the old property relations, and the old society, or\\nto cramping the modern means of production and of exchange,\\nwithin the framework of the old property relations that have\\nbeen, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  In either\\ncase, it is both reactionary and Utopian.\\n\\nIts last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture,\\npatriarchal relations in agriculture.\\n\\nUltimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all\\nintoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism\\nended in a miserable fit of the blues.\\n\\n\\nC. German, or \"True,\" Socialism\\n\\nThe Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature\\nthat originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and\\nthat was the expression of the struggle against this power, was\\nintroduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that\\ncountry, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.\\n\\nGerman philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits,\\neagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when\\nthese writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social\\nconditions had not immigrated along with them.  In contact with\\nGerman social conditions, this French literature lost all its\\nimmediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary\\naspect.  Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth\\ncentury, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing\\nmore than the demands of \"Practical Reason\" in general, and the\\nutterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie\\nsignified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was\\nbound to be, of true human Will generally.\\n\\nThe world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing\\nthe new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical\\nconscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without\\ndeserting their own philosophic point of view.\\n\\nThis annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign\\nlanguage is appropriated, namely, by translation.\\n\\nIt is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic\\nSaints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of\\nancient heathendom had been written.  The German literate\\nreversed this process with the profane French literature.  They\\nwrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.\\nFor instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic\\nfunctions of money, they wrote \"Alienation of Humanity,\" and\\nbeneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote\\n\"dethronement of the Category of the General,\" and so forth.\\n\\nThe introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of\\nthe French historical criticisms they dubbed \"Philosophy of\\nAction,\" \"True Socialism,\" \"German Science of Socialism,\"\\n\"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,\" and so on.\\n\\nThe French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely\\nemasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express\\nthe struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having\\novercome \"French one-sidedness\" and of representing, not true\\nrequirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the\\nproletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who\\nbelongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm\\nof philosophical fantasy.\\n\\nThis German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously\\nand solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such\\nmountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic\\ninnocence.\\n\\nThe fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie,\\nagainst feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the\\nliberal movement, became more earnest.\\n\\nBy this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to \"True\"\\nSocialism of confronting the political movement with the\\nSocialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas\\nagainst liberalism, against representative government, against\\nbourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois\\nlegislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to\\nthe masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose,\\nby this bourgeois movement.  German Socialism forgot, in the nick\\nof time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was,\\npresupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its\\ncorresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political\\nconstitution adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment\\nwas the object of the pending struggle in Germany.\\n\\nTo the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,\\nprofessors, country squires and officials, it served as a welcome\\nscarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\\n\\nIt was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and\\nbullets with which these same governments, just at that time,\\ndosed the German working-class risings.\\n\\nWhile this \"True\" Socialism thus served the governments as a\\nweapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time,\\ndirectly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the\\nGerman Philistines.  In Germany the petty-bourgeois class, a\\nrelic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly\\ncropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis\\nof the existing state of things.\\n\\nTo preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of\\nthings in Germany.  The industrial and political supremacy of the\\nbourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction; on the one\\nhand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the\\nrise of a revolutionary proletariat.  \"True\" Socialism appeared to\\nkill these two birds with one stone.  It spread like an epidemic.\\n\\nThe robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers\\nof rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this\\ntranscendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their\\nsorry \"eternal truths,\" all skin and bone, served to wonderfully\\nincrease the sale of their goods amongst such a public.  And on\\nits part, German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own\\ncalling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois\\nPhilistine.\\n\\nIt proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the\\nGerman petty Philistine to be the typical man.  To every\\nvillainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden, higher,\\nSocialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real\\ncharacter.  It went to the extreme length of directly opposing\\nthe \"brutally destructive\" tendency of Communism, and of\\nproclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class\\nstruggles.  With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist\\nand Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany\\nbelong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.\\n\\n\\n2. CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM\\n\\nA part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social\\ngrievances, in order to secure the continued existence of\\nbourgeois society.\\n\\nTo this section belong economists, philanthropists,\\nhumanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class,\\norganisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of\\ncruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner\\nreformers of every imaginable kind.  This form of Socialism has,\\nmoreover, been worked out into complete systems.\\n\\nWe may cite Proudhon\\'s Philosophie de la Misere as an example of\\nthis form.\\n\\nThe Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern\\nsocial conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily\\nresulting therefrom.  They desire the existing state of society\\nminus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements.  They wish\\nfor a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.  The bourgeoisie\\nnaturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the\\nbest; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable\\nconception into various more or less complete systems.  In\\nrequiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby\\nto march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but\\nrequires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within\\nthe bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its\\nhateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.\\n\\nA second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this\\nSocialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in\\nthe eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political\\nreform, but only a change in the material conditions of\\nexistence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to\\nthem.  By changes in the material conditions of existence, this\\nform of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of\\nthe bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be\\neffected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based\\non the continued existence of these relations; reforms,\\ntherefore, that in no respect affect the relations between\\ncapital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and\\nsimplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\\n\\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only\\nwhen, it becomes a mere figure of speech.\\n\\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class.  Protective\\nduties: for the benefit of the working class.  Prison Reform: for\\nthe benefit of the working class.  This is the last word and the\\nonly seriously meant word of bourgeois Socialism.\\n\\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois--for\\nthe benefit of the working class.\\n\\n\\n3.  CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM\\n\\nWe do not here refer to that literature which, in every great\\nmodern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the\\nproletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\\n\\nThe first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own\\nends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society\\nwas being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing\\nto the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to\\nthe absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation,\\nconditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced\\nby the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary\\nliterature that accompanied these first movements of the\\nproletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It\\ninculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its\\ncrudest form.\\n\\nThe Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of\\nSaint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others, spring into existence in\\nthe early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle\\nbetween proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois\\nand Proletarians).\\n\\nThe founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as\\nwell as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form\\nof society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them\\nthe spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any\\nindependent political movement.\\n\\nSince the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with\\nthe development of industry, the economic situation, as they find\\nit, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the\\nemancipation of the proletariat.  They therefore search after a\\nnew social science, after new social laws, that are to create\\nthese conditions.\\n\\nHistorical action is to yield to their personal inventive\\naction, historically created conditions of emancipation to\\nfantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation\\nof the proletariat to the organisation of society specially\\ncontrived by these inventors.  Future history resolves itself, in\\ntheir eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of\\ntheir social plans.\\n\\nIn the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring\\nchiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most\\nsuffering class.  Only from the point of view of being the most\\nsuffering class does the proletariat exist for them.\\n\\nThe undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their\\nown surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider\\nthemselves far superior to all class antagonisms.  They want to\\nimprove the condition of every member of society, even that of\\nthe most favoured.  Hence, they habitually appeal to society at\\nlarge, without  distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the\\nruling class.  For how can people, when once they understand\\ntheir system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the\\nbest possible state of society?\\n\\nHence, they reject all political, and especially all\\nrevolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by\\npeaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily\\ndoomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way\\nfor the new social Gospel.\\n\\nSuch fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time\\nwhen the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has\\nbut a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with\\nthe first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general\\nreconstruction of society.\\n\\nBut these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a\\ncritical element. They attack every principle of existing society.\\nHence they are full of the most valuable materials for the\\nenlightenment of the working class. The practical measures\\nproposed in them--such as the abolition of the distinction\\nbetween town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of\\nindustries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage\\nsystem, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the\\nfunctions of the State into a mere superintendence of production,\\nall these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class\\nantagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and\\nwhich, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest,\\nindistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore,\\nare of a purely Utopian character.\\n\\nThe significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism\\nbears an inverse relation to historical development.  In\\nproportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes\\ndefinite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest,\\nthese fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all\\ntheoretical justification.  Therefore, although the originators\\nof these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their\\ndisciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects.\\nThey hold fast by the original views of their masters, in\\nopposition to the progressive historical development of the\\nproletariat.  They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently,\\nto deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.\\nThey still dream of experimental realisation of their social\\nUtopias, of founding isolated \"phalansteres,\" of establishing\\n\"Home Colonies,\"  of setting up a \"Little Icaria\"--duodecimo\\neditions of the New Jerusalem--and to realise all these castles\\nin the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and\\npurses of the bourgeois.  By degrees they sink into the category\\nof the reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above,\\ndiffering from these only by more systematic pedantry, and\\nby their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous\\neffects of their social science.\\n\\nThey, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the\\npart of the working class; such action, according to them, can\\nonly result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\\n\\nThe Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France,\\nrespectively, oppose the Chartists and the Reformistes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.  POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE\\nVARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES\\n\\nSection II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the\\nexisting working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England\\nand the Agrarian Reformers in America.\\n\\nThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims,\\nfor the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working\\nclass; but in the movement of the present, they also represent\\nand take care of the future of that movement.  In France the\\nCommunists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the\\nconservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the\\nright to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and\\nillusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\\n\\nIn Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight\\nof the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements,\\npartly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of\\nradical bourgeois.\\n\\nIn Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian\\nrevolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that\\nparty which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\\n\\nIn Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a\\nrevolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal\\nsquirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\\n\\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the\\nworking class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile\\nantagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the\\nGerman workers may straightaway use, as so many weapons against\\nthe bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the\\nbourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy,\\nand in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in\\nGermany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately\\nbegin.\\n\\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because\\nthat country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that\\nis bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions\\nof European civilisation, and with a much more developed\\nproletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of\\nFrance in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois\\nrevolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately\\nfollowing proletarian revolution.\\n\\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary\\nmovement against the existing social and political order of\\nthings.\\n\\nIn all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading\\nquestion in each, the property question, no matter what its\\ndegree of development at the time.\\n\\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of\\nthe democratic parties of all countries.\\n\\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.\\nThey openly declare that their ends can be attained only by\\nthe forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.\\nLet the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.\\nThe proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.\\nThey have a world to win.\\n\\n\\n           WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Communist Manifesto\\nby Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 61.txt or 61.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/6/61/\\n\\nTranscribed by Allen Lutins with assistance from Jim Tarzia.\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

The flowers which were my solace and pleasure\\nsuggested titles for the tales and gave an interest to the work.\\n\\nIf my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common\\nblossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.\\n\\nL.M. ALCOTT.\\n\\nSEPTEMBER, 1887.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMAY FLOWERS\\n\\n\\nBeing Boston girls, of course they got up a club for mental\\nimprovement, and, as they were all descendants of the Pilgrim\\nFathers, they called it the Mayflower Club. A very good name, and\\nthe six young girls who were members of it made a very pretty posy\\nwhen they met together, once a week, to sew, and read well-chosen\\nbooks. At the first meeting of the season, after being separated all\\nsummer, there was a good deal of gossip to be attended to before the\\nquestion, “What shall we read?” came up for serious discussion.\\n\\nAnna Winslow, as president, began by proposing “Happy Dodd;” but a\\nchorus of “I’ve read it!” made her turn to her list for another\\ntitle.\\n\\n“‘Prisoners of Poverty’ is all about workingwomen, very true and\\nvery sad; but Mamma said it might do us good to know something of\\nthe hard times other girls have,” said Anna, soberly; for she was a\\nthoughtful creature, very anxious to do her duty in all ways.\\n\\n“I’d rather not know about sad things, since I can’t help to make\\nthem any better,” answered Ella Carver, softly patting the apple\\nblossoms she was embroidering on a bit of blue satin.\\n\\n“But we might help if we really tried, I suppose; you know how much\\nHappy Dodd did when she once began, and she was only a poor little\\ngirl without half the means of doing good which we have,” said Anna,\\nglad to discuss the matter, for she had a little plan in her head\\nand wanted to prepare a way for proposing it.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m always saying that I have more than my share of fun and\\ncomfort and pretty things, and that I ought and will share them with\\nsome one. But I don’t do it; and now and then, when I hear about\\nreal poverty, or dreadful sickness, I feel so wicked it quite upsets\\nme. If I knew HOW to begin, I really would. But dirty little\\nchildren don’t come in my way, nor tipsy women to be reformed, nor\\nnice lame girls to sing and pray with, as it all happens in books,”\\n cried Marion Warren, with such a remorseful expression on her merry\\nround face that her mates laughed with one accord.\\n\\n“I know something that I COULD do if I only had the courage to begin\\nit. But Papa would shake his head unbelievingly, and Mamma worry\\nabout its being proper, and it would interfere with my music, and\\neverything nice that I especially wanted to go to would be sure\\nto come on whatever day I set for my good work, and I should get\\ndiscouraged or ashamed, and not half do it, so I don’t begin, but I\\nknow I ought.” And Elizabeth Alden rolled her large eyes from one\\nfriend to another, as if appealing to them to goad her to this duty\\nby counsel and encouragement of some sort.\\n\\n“Well, I suppose it’s right, but I do perfectly hate to go poking\\nround among poor folks, smelling bad smells, seeing dreadful sights,\\nhearing woful tales, and running the risk of catching fever, and\\ndiphtheria, and horrid things. I don’t pretend to like charity, but\\nsay right out I’m a silly, selfish wretch, and want to enjoy every\\nminute, and not worry about other people. Isn’t it shameful?”\\n\\nMaggie Bradford looked such a sweet little sinner as she boldly made\\nthis sad confession, that no one could scold her, though Ida\\nStandish, her bosom friend, shook her head, and Anna said, with a\\nsigh: “I’m afraid we all feel very much as Maggie does, though we\\ndon’t own it so honestly. Last spring, when I was ill and thought I\\nmight die, I was so ashamed of my idle, frivolous winter, that I\\nfelt as if I’d give all I had to be able to live it over and do\\nbetter. Much is not expected of a girl of eighteen, I know; but oh!\\nthere were heaps of kind little things I MIGHT have done if I hadn’t\\nthought only of myself. I resolved if I lived I’d try at least to be\\nless selfish, and make some one happier for my being in the world. I\\ntell you, girls, it’s rather solemn when you lie expecting to die,\\nand your sins come up before you, even though they are very small\\nones. I never shall forget it, and after my lovely summer I mean to\\nbe a better girl, and lead a better life if I can.”\\n\\nAnna was so much in earnest that her words, straight out of a very\\ninnocent and contrite heart, touched her hearers deeply, and put\\nthem into the right mood to embrace her proposition. No one spoke\\nfor a moment, then Maggie said quietly,--\\n\\n“I know what it is. I felt very much so when the horses ran away,\\nand for fifteen minutes I sat clinging to Mamma, expecting to be\\nkilled. Every unkind, undutiful word I’d ever said to her came back\\nto me, and was worse to bear than the fear of sudden death. It\\nscared a great deal of naughtiness out of me, and dear Mamma and I\\nhave been more to each other ever since.”\\n\\n“Let us begin with ‘The Prisoners of Poverty,’ and perhaps it will\\nshow us something to do,” said Lizzie. “But I must say I never felt\\nas if shop-girls needed much help; they generally seem so contented\\nwith themselves, and so pert or patronizing to us, that I don’t pity\\nthem a bit, though it must be a hard life.”\\n\\n“I think we can’t do MUCH in that direction, except set an example\\nof good manners when we go shopping. I wanted to propose that we\\neach choose some small charity for this winter, and do it\\nfaithfully. That will teach us how to do more by and by, and we can\\nhelp one another with our experiences, perhaps, or amuse with our\\nfailures. What do you say?” asked Anna, surveying her five friends\\nwith a persuasive smile.\\n\\n“What COULD we do?”\\n\\n“People will call us goody-goody.”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea how to go to work.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mamma will let me.”\\n\\n“We’d better change our names from May Flowers to sisters of\\ncharity, and wear meek black bonnets and flapping cloaks.”\\n\\nAnna received these replies with great composure, and waited for the\\nmeeting to come to order, well knowing that the girls would have\\ntheir fun and outcry first, and then set to work in good earnest.\\n\\n“I think it’s a lovely idea, and I’ll carry out my plan. But I won’t\\ntell what it is yet; you’d all shout, and say I couldn’t do it, but\\nif you were trying also, that would keep me up to the mark,” said\\nLizzie, with a decided snap of her scissors, as she trimmed the\\nedges of a plush case for her beloved music.\\n\\n“Suppose we all keep our attempts secret, and not let our right hand\\nknow what the left hand does? It’s such fun to mystify people, and\\nthen no one can laugh at us. If we fail, we can say nothing; if we\\nsucceed, we can tell of it and get our reward. I’d like that way,\\nand will look round at once for some especially horrid boot-black,\\nungrateful old woman, or ugly child, and devote myself to him, her,\\nor it with the patience of a saint,” cried Maggie, caught by the\\nidea of doing good in secret and being found out by accident.\\n\\nThe other girls agreed, after some discussion, and then Anna took\\nthe floor again.\\n\\n“I propose that we each work in our own way till next May, then, at\\nour last meeting, report what we have done, truly and honestly, and\\nplan something better for next year. Is it a vote?”\\n\\nIt evidently was a unanimous vote, for five gold thimbles went up,\\nand five blooming faces smiled as the five girlish voices cried,\\n“Aye!”\\n\\n“Very well, now let us decide what to read, and begin at once. I\\nthink the ‘Prisoners’ a good book, and we shall doubtless get some\\nhints from it.”\\n\\nSo they began, and for an hour one pleasant voice after the other\\nread aloud those sad, true stories of workingwomen and their hard\\nlives, showing these gay young creatures what their pretty clothes\\ncost the real makers of them, and how much injustice, suffering, and\\nwasted strength went into them. It was very sober reading, but most\\nabsorbing; for the crochet needles went slower and slower, the\\nlace-work lay idle, and a great tear shone like a drop of dew on the\\napple blossoms as Ella listened to “Rose’s Story.” They skipped the\\nstatistics, and dipped here and there as each took her turn; but\\nwhen the two hours were over, and it was time for the club to\\nadjourn, all the members were deeply interested in that pathetic\\nbook, and more in earnest than before; for this glimpse into other\\nlives showed them how much help was needed, and made them anxious to\\nlend a hand.\\n\\n“We can’t do much, being ‘only girls,’” said Anna; “but if each does\\none small chore somewhere it will pave the way for better work; so\\nwe will all try, at least, though it seems like so many ants trying\\nto move a mountain.”\\n\\n“Well, ants build nests higher than a man’s head in Africa; you\\nremember the picture of them in our old geographies? And we can do\\nas much, I’m sure, if each tugs her pebble or straw faithfully. I\\nshall shoulder mine to-morrow if Mamma is willing,” answered Lizzie,\\nshutting up her work-bag as if she had her resolution inside and was\\nafraid it might evaporate before she got home.\\n\\n“I shall stand on the Common, and proclaim aloud, ‘Here’s a nice\\nyoung missionary, in want of a job! Charity for sale cheap! Who’ll\\nbuy? who’ll buy?’” said Maggie, with a resigned expression, and a\\nsanctimonious twang to her voice.\\n\\n“I shall wait and see what comes to me, since I don’t know what I’m\\nfit for;” and Marion gazed out of the window as if expecting to see\\nsome interesting pauper waiting for her to appear.\\n\\n“I shall ask Miss Bliss for advice; she knows all about the poor,\\nand will give me a good start,” added prudent Ida, who resolved to\\ndo nothing rashly lest she should fail.\\n\\n“I shall probably have a class of dirty little girls, and teach them\\nhow to sew, as I can’t do anything else. They won’t learn much, but\\nsteal, and break, and mess, and be a dreadful trial, and I shall get\\nlaughed at and wish I hadn’t done it. Still I shall try it, and\\nsacrifice my fancy-work to the cause of virtue,” said Ella,\\ncarefully putting away her satin glove-case with a fond glance at\\nthe delicate flowers she so loved to embroider.\\n\\n“I have no plans, but want to do so much! I shall have to wait till\\nI discover what is best. After to-day we won’t speak of our work, or\\nit won’t be a secret any longer. In May we will report. Good luck to\\nall, and good-by till next Saturday.”\\n\\nWith these farewell words from their president the girls departed,\\nwith great plans and new ideas simmering in their young heads and\\nhearts.\\n\\nIt seemed a vast undertaking; but where there is a will there is\\nalways a way, and soon it was evident that each had found “a little\\nchore” to do for sweet charity’s sake. Not a word was said at the\\nweekly meetings, but the artless faces betrayed all shades of hope,\\ndiscouragement, pride, and doubt, as their various attempts seemed\\nlikely to succeed or fail. Much curiosity was felt, and a few\\naccidental words, hints, or meetings in queer places, were very\\nexciting, though nothing was discovered.\\n\\nMarion was often seen in a North End car, and Lizzie in a South End\\ncar, with a bag of books and papers. Ella haunted a certain shop\\nwhere fancy articles were sold, and Ida always brought plain sewing\\nto the club. Maggie seemed very busy at home, and Anna was found\\nwriting industriously several times when one of her friends called.\\nAll seemed very happy, and rather important when outsiders\\nquestioned them about their affairs. But they had their pleasures as\\nusual, and seemed to enjoy them with an added relish, as if they\\nrealized as never before how many blessings they possessed, and were\\ngrateful for them.\\n\\nSo the winter passed, and slowly something new and pleasant seemed\\nto come into the lives of these young girls. The listless,\\ndiscontented look some of them used to wear passed away; a sweet\\nearnestness and a cheerful activity made them charming, though they\\ndid not know it, and wondered when people said, “That set of girls\\nare growing up beautifully; they will make fine women by and by.”\\n The mayflowers were budding under the snow, and as spring came on\\nthe fresh perfume began to steal out, the rosy faces to brighten,\\nand the last year’s dead leaves to fall away, leaving the young\\nplants green and strong.\\n\\nOn the 15th of May the club met for the last time that season, as\\nsome left town early, and all were full of spring work and summer\\nplans. Every member was in her place at an unusually early hour that\\nday, and each wore an air of mingled anxiety, expectation, and\\nsatisfaction, pleasant to behold. Anna called them to order with\\nthree raps of her thimble and a beaming smile.\\n\\n“We need not choose a book for our reading to-day, as each of us is\\nto contribute an original history of her winter’s work. I know it\\nwill be very interesting, and I hope more instructive, than some of\\nthe novels we have read. Who shall begin?”\\n\\n“You! you!” was the unanimous answer; for all loved and respected\\nher very much, and felt that their presiding officer should open the\\nball.\\n\\nAnna colored modestly, but surprised her friends by the composure\\nwith which she related her little story, quite as if used to public\\nspeaking.\\n\\n“You know I told you last November that I should have to look about\\nfor something that I COULD do. I did look a long time, and was\\nrather in despair, when my task came to me in the most unexpected\\nway. Our winter work was being done, so I had a good deal of\\nshopping on my hands, and found it less a bore than usual, because I\\nliked to watch the shop-girls, and wish I dared ask some of them if\\nI could help them. I went often to get trimmings and buttons at\\nCotton’s, and had a good deal to do with the two girls at that\\ncounter. They were very obliging and patient about matching some jet\\nornaments for Mamma, and I found out that their names were Mary and\\nMaria Porter. I liked them, for they were very neat and plain in\\ntheir dress,--not like some, who seem to think that if their waists\\nare small, and their hair dressed in the fashion, it is no matter\\nhow soiled their collars are, nor how untidy their nails. Well, one\\nday when I went for certain kinds of buttons which were to be made\\nfor us, Maria, the younger one, who took the order, was not there. I\\nasked for her, and Mary said she was at home with a lame knee. I was\\nso sorry, and ventured to put a few questions in a friendly way.\\nMary seemed glad to tell her troubles, and I found that ‘Ria,’ as\\nshe called her sister, had been suffering for a long time, but did\\nnot complain for fear of losing her place. No stools are allowed at\\nCotton’s, so the poor girls stand nearly all day, or rest a minute\\nnow and then on a half-opened drawer. I’d seen Maria doing it, and\\nwondered why some one did not make a stir about seats in this place,\\nas they have in other stores and got stools for the shop women. I\\ndidn’t dare to speak to the gentlemen, but I gave Mary the Jack\\nroses I wore in my breast, and asked if I might take some books or\\nflowers to poor Maria. It was lovely to see her sad face light up\\nand hear her thank me when I went to see her, for she was very\\nlonely without her sister, and discouraged about her place. She did\\nnot lose it entirely, but had to work at home, for her lame knee\\nwill be a long time in getting well. I begged Mamma and Mrs.\\nAilingham to speak to Mr. Cotton for her; so she got the mending of\\nthe jet and bead work to do, and buttons to cover, and things of\\nthat sort. Mary takes them to and fro, and Maria feels so happy not\\nto be idle. We also got stools, for all the other girls in that\\nshop. Mrs. Allingham is so rich and kind she can do anything, and\\nnow it’s such a comfort to see those tired things resting when off\\nduty that I often go in and enjoy the sight.”\\n\\nAnna paused as cries of “Good! good!” interrupted her tale; but she\\ndid not add the prettiest part of it, and tell how the faces of the\\nyoung women behind the counters brightened when she came in, nor how\\ngladly all served the young lady who showed them what a true\\ngentlewoman was.\\n\\n“I hope that isn’t all?” said Maggie, eagerly.\\n\\n“Only a little more. I know you will laugh when I tell you that I’ve\\nbeen reading papers to a class of shop-girls at the Union once a\\nweek all winter.”\\n\\nA murmur of awe and admiration greeted this deeply interesting\\nstatement; for, true to the traditions of the modern Athens in which\\nthey lived, the girls all felt the highest respect for “papers” on\\nany subject, it being the fashion for ladies, old and young, to read\\nand discuss every subject, from pottery to Pantheism, at the various\\nclubs all over the city.\\n\\n“It came about very naturally,” continued Anna, as if anxious to\\nexplain her seeming audacity. “I used to go to see Molly and Ria,\\nand heard all about their life and its few pleasures, and learned to\\nlike them more and more. They had only each other in the world,\\nlived in two rooms, worked all day, and in the way of amusement or\\ninstruction had only what they found at the Union in the evening. I\\nwent with them a few times, and saw how useful and pleasant it was,\\nand wanted to help, as other kind girls only a little older than I\\ndid. Eva Randal read a letter from a friend in Russia one time, and\\nthe girls enjoyed it very much. That reminded me of my brother\\nGeorge’s lively journals, written when he was abroad. You remember\\nhow we used to laugh over them when he sent them home? Well, when I\\nwas begged to give them an evening, I resolved to try one of those\\namusing journal-letters, and chose the best,--all about how George\\nand a friend went to the different places Dickens describes in some\\nof his funny books. I wish you could have seen how those dear girls\\nenjoyed it, and laughed till they cried over the dismay of the boys,\\nwhen they knocked at a door in Kingsgate Street, and asked if Mrs.\\nGamp lived there. It was actually a barber’s shop, and a little man,\\nvery like Poll Sweedlepipes, told them ‘Mrs. Britton was the nuss as\\nlived there now.’ It upset those rascals to come so near the truth,\\nand they ran away because they couldn’t keep sober.”\\n\\nThe members of the club indulged in a general smile as they recalled\\nthe immortal Sairey with “the bottle on the mankle-shelf,” the\\n“cowcuber,” and the wooden pippins. Then Anna continued, with an air\\nof calm satisfaction, quite sure now of her audience and herself,--\\n\\n“It was a great success. So I went on, and when the journals were\\ndone, I used to read other things, and picked up books for their\\nlibrary, and helped in any way I could, while learning to know them\\nbetter and give them confidence in me. They are proud and shy, just\\nas we should be but if you REALLY want to be friends and don’t mind\\nrebuffs now and then, they come to trust and like you, and there is\\nso much to do for them one never need sit idle any more. I won’t\\ngive names, as they don’t like it, nor tell how I tried to serve\\nthem, but it is very sweet and good for me to have found this work,\\nand to know that each year I can do it better and better. So I feel\\nencouraged and am very glad I began, as I hope you all are. Now, who\\ncomes next?”\\n\\nAs Anna ended, the needles dropped and ten soft hands gave her a\\nhearty round of applause; for all felt that she had done well, and\\nchosen a task especially fitted to her powers, as she had money,\\ntime, tact, and the winning manners that make friends everywhere.\\n\\nBeaming with pleasure at their approval, but feeling that they made\\ntoo much of her small success, Anna called the club to order by\\nsaying, “Ella looks as if she were anxious to tell her experiences,\\nso perhaps we had better ask her to hold forth next.”\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried the girls; and, nothing loath, Ella promptly\\nbegan, with twinkling eyes and a demure smile, for HER story ended\\nromantically.\\n\\n“If you are interested in shop-girls, Miss President and ladies, you\\nwill like to know that _I_ am one, at least a silent partner and\\nco-worker in a small fancy store at the West End.”\\n\\n“No!” exclaimed the amazed club with one voice; and, satisfied with\\nthis sensational beginning Ella went on.\\n\\n“I really am, and you have bought some of my fancy-work. Isn’t that\\na good joke? You needn’t stare so, for I actually made that\\nneedle-book, Anna, and my partner knit Lizzie’s new cloud. This is\\nthe way it all happened. I didn’t wish to waste any time, but one\\ncan’t rush into the street and collar shabby little girls, and say,\\n‘Come along and learn to sew,’ without a struggle, so I thought I’d\\ngo and ask Mrs. Brown how to begin. Her branch of the Associated\\nCharities is in Laurel Street, not far from our house, you know; and\\nthe very day after our last meeting I posted off to get my ‘chore.’\\nI expected to have to fit work for poor needlewomen, or go to see\\nsome dreadful sick creature, or wash dirty little Pats, and was\\nbracing up my mind for whatever might come, as I toiled up the hill\\nin a gale of wind. Suddenly my hat flew off and went gayly skipping\\naway, to the great delight of some black imps, who only grinned and\\ncheered me on as I trotted after it with wild grabs and wrathful\\ndodges. I got it at last out of a puddle, and there I was in a nice\\nmess. The elastic was broken, feather wet, and the poor thing all\\nmud and dirt. I didn’t care much, as it was my old one,--dressed for\\nmy work, you see. But I couldn’t go home bareheaded, and I didn’t\\nknow a soul in that neighborhood. I turned to step into a grocery\\nstore at the corner, to borrow a brush or buy a sheet of paper to\\nwear, for I looked like a lunatic with my battered hat and my hair\\nin a perfect mop. Luckily I spied a woman’s fancy shop on the other\\ncorner, and rushed in there to hide myself, for the brats hooted and\\npeople stared. It was a very small shop, and behind the counter sat\\na tall, thin, washed-out-looking woman, making a baby’s hood. She\\nlooked poor and blue and rather sour, but took pity on me; and while\\nshe sewed the cord, dried the feather, and brushed off the dirt, I\\nwarmed myself and looked about to see what I could buy in return for\\nher trouble.\\n\\n“A few children’s aprons hung in the little window, with some knit\\nlace, balls, and old-fashioned garters, two or three dolls, and a\\nvery poor display of small wares. In a show-case, however, on the\\ntable that was the counter, I found some really pretty things, made\\nof plush, silk, and ribbon, with a good deal of taste. So I said I’d\\nbuy a needle-book, and a gay ball, and a pair of distracting baby’s\\nshoes, made to look like little open-work socks with pink\\nankle-ties, so cunning and dainty, I was glad to get them for Cousin\\nClara’s baby. The woman seemed pleased, though she had a grim way of\\ntalking, and never smiled once. I observed that she handled my hat\\nas if used to such work, and evidently liked to do it. I thanked her\\nfor repairing damages so quickly and well, and she said, with my hat\\non her hand, as if she hated to part with it, ‘I’m used to\\nmillineryin’ and never should have give it up, if I didn’t have my\\nfolks to see to. I took this shop, hopin’ to make things go, as such\\na place was needed round here, but mother broke down, and is a sight\\nof care; so I couldn’t leave her, and doctors is expensive, and\\ntimes hard, and I had to drop my trade, and fall back on pins and\\nneedles, and so on.’”\\n\\nElla was a capital mimic, and imitated the nasal tones of the\\nVermont woman to the life, with a doleful pucker of her own blooming\\nface, which gave such a truthful picture of poor Miss Almira Miller\\nthat those who had seen her recognized it at once, and laughed\\ngayly.\\n\\n“Just as I was murmuring a few words of regret at her bad luck,”\\n continued Ella, “a sharp voice called out from a back room, ‘Almiry!\\nAlmiry! come here.’ It sounded very like a cross parrot, but it was\\nthe old lady, and while I put on my hat I heard her asking who was\\nin the shop, and what we were ‘gabbin’ about.’ Her daughter told\\nher, and the old soul demanded to ‘see the gal;’ so I went in, being\\nready for fun as usual. It was a little, dark, dismal place, but as\\nneat as a pin, and in the bed sat a regular Grandma Smallweed\\nsmoking a pipe, with a big cap, a snuff-box, and a red cotton\\nhandkerchief. She was a tiny, dried-up thing, brown as a berry, with\\neyes like black beads, a nose and chin that nearly met, and hands\\nlike birds’ claws. But such a fierce, lively, curious, blunt old\\nlady you never saw, and I didn’t know what would be the end of me\\nwhen she began to question, then to scold, and finally to demand\\nthat ‘folks should come and trade to Almiry’s shop after promisin’\\nthey would, and she havin’ took a lease of the place on account of\\nthem lies.’ I wanted to laugh, but dared not do it, so just let her\\ncroak, for the daughter had to go to her customers. The old lady’s\\ntirade informed me that they came from Vermont, had ‘been wal on ‘t\\ntill father died and the farm was sold.’ Then it seems the women\\ncame to Boston and got on pretty well till ‘a stroke of numb-palsy,’\\nwhatever that is, made the mother helpless and kept Almiry at home\\nto care for her. I can’t tell you how funny and yet how sad it was\\nto see the poor old soul, so full of energy and yet so helpless, and\\nthe daughter so discouraged with her pathetic little shop and no\\ncustomers to speak of. I did not know what to say till ‘Grammer\\nMiller,’ as the children call her, happened to say, when she took up\\nher knitting after the lecture, ‘If folks who go spendin’ money\\nreckless on redic’lus toys for Christmas only knew what nice things,\\nuseful and fancy, me and Almiry could make ef we had the goods,\\nthey’d jest come round this corner and buy ‘em, and keep me out of a\\nOld Woman’s Home and that good, hard-workin’ gal of mine out of a\\n‘sylum; for go there she will ef she don’t get a boost somehow, with\\nrent and firin’ and vittles all on her shoulders, and me only able\\nto wag them knittin’-needles.’\\n\\n“‘I will buy things here, and tell all my friends about it, and I\\nhave a drawer full of pretty bits of silk and velvet and plush, that\\nI will give Miss Miller for her work, if she will let me.’ I added\\nthat, for I saw that Almiry was rather proud, and hid her troubles\\nunder a grim look.\\n\\n“That pleased the old lady, and, lowering her voice, she said, with\\na motherly sort of look in her beady eyes: ‘Seein’ as you are so\\nfriendly, I’ll tell you what frets me most, a layin’ here, a burden\\nto my darter. She kep’ company with Nathan Baxter, a master\\ncarpenter up to Westminster where we lived, and ef father hadn’t a\\ndied suddin’ they’d a ben married. They waited a number o’ years,\\nworkin’ to their trades, and we was hopin’ all would turn out wal,\\nwhen troubles come, and here we be. Nathan’s got his own folks to\\nsee to, and Almiry won’t add to HIS load with hern, nor leave me; so\\nshe give him back his ring, and jest buckled to all alone. She don’t\\nsay a word, but it’s wearin’ her to a shadder, and I can’t do a\\nthing to help, but make a few pinballs, knit garters, and kiver\\nholders. Ef she got a start in business it would cheer her up a\\nsight, and give her a kind of a hopeful prospeck, for old folks\\ncan’t live forever, and Nathan is a waitin’, faithful and true.’\\n\\n“That just finished me, for I am romantic, and do enjoy love stories\\nwith all my heart, even if the lovers are only a skinny spinster and\\na master carpenter. So I just resolved to see what I could do for\\npoor Almiry and the peppery old lady. I didn’t promise anything but\\nmy bits, and, taking the things I bought, went home to talk it over\\nwith Mamma. I found she had often got pins and tape, and such small\\nwares, at the little shop, and found it very convenient, though she\\nknew nothing about the Millers. She was willing I should help if I\\ncould, but advised going slowly, and seeing what they could do\\nfirst. We did not dare to treat them like beggars, and send them\\nmoney and clothes, and tea and sugar, as we do the Irish, for they\\nwere evidently respectable people, and proud as poor. So I took my\\nbundle of odds and ends, and Mamma added some nice large pieces of\\ndresses we had done with, and gave a fine order for aprons and\\nholders and balls for our church fair.\\n\\n“It would have done your hearts good, girls, to see those poor old\\nfaces light up as I showed my scraps, and asked if the work would be\\nready by Christmas. Grammer fairly swam in the gay colors I strewed\\nover her bed, and enjoyed them like a child, while Almiry tried to\\nbe grim, but had to give it up, as she began at once to cut out\\naprons, and dropped tears all over the muslin when her back was\\nturned to me. I didn’t know a washed-out old maid COULD be so\\npathetic.”\\n\\nElla stopped to give a regretful sigh over her past blindness, while\\nher hearers made a sympathetic murmur; for young hearts are very\\ntender, and take an innocent interest in lovers’ sorrows, no matter\\nhow humble.\\n\\n“Well, that was the beginning of it. I got so absorbed in making\\nthings go well that I didn’t look any further, but just ‘buckled to’\\nwith Miss Miller and helped run that little shop. No one knew me in\\nthat street, so I slipped in and out, and did what I liked. The old\\nlady and I got to be great friends; though she often pecked and\\ncroaked like a cross raven, and was very wearing. I kept her busy\\nwith her ‘pin-balls and knittin’-work, and supplied Almiry with\\npretty materials for the various things I found she could make. You\\nwouldn’t believe what dainty bows those long fingers could tie, what\\nravishing doll’s hats she would make out of a scrap of silk and\\nlace, or the ingenious things she concocted with cones and shells\\nand fans and baskets. I love such work, and used to go and help her\\noften, for I wanted her window and shop to be full for Christmas,\\nand lure in plenty of customers. Our new toys and the little cases\\nof sewing silk sold well, and people began to come more, after I\\nlent Almiry some money to lay in a stock of better goods. Papa\\nenjoyed my business venture immensely, and was never tired of joking\\nabout it. He actually went and bought balls for four small black\\nboys who were gluing their noses to the window one day, spellbound\\nby the orange, red, and blue treasures displayed there. He liked my\\npartner’s looks, though he teased me by saying that we’d better add\\nlemonade to our stock, as poor, dear Almiry’s acid face would make\\nlemons unnecessary, and sugar and water were cheap.\\n\\n“Well, Christmas came, and we did a great business, for Mamma came\\nand sent others, and our fancy things were as pretty and cheaper\\nthan those at the art stores, so they went well, and the Millers\\nwere cheered up, and I felt encouraged, and we took a fresh start\\nafter the holidays. One of my gifts at New Year was my own\\nglove-case,--you remember the apple-blossom thing I began last\\nautumn? I put it in our window to fill up, and Mamma bought it, and\\ngave it to me full of elegant gloves, with a sweet note, and Papa\\nsent a check to ‘Miller, Warren & Co.’ I was so pleased and proud I\\ncould hardly help telling you all. But the best joke was the day you\\ngirls came in and bought our goods, and I peeped at you through the\\ncrack of the door, being in the back room dying with laughter to see\\nyou look round, and praise our ‘nice assortment of useful and pretty\\narticles.’”\\n\\n“That’s all very well, and we can bear to be laughed at if you\\nsucceeded, Miss. But I don’t believe you did, for no Millers are\\nthere now. Have you taken a palatial store on Boylston Street for\\nthis year, intending to run it alone? We’ll all patronize it, and\\nyour name will look well on a sign,” said Maggie, wondering what the\\nend of Ella’s experience had been.\\n\\n“Ah! I still have the best of it, for my romance finished up\\ndelightfully, as you shall hear. We did well all winter, and no\\nwonder. What was needed was a little ‘boost’ in the right direction,\\nand I could give it; so my Millers were much comforted, and we were\\ngood friends. But in March Grammer died suddenly, and poor Almiry\\nmourned as if she had been the sweetest mother in the world. The old\\nlady’s last wishes were to be ‘laid out harnsome in a cap with a\\npale blue satin ribbin, white wasn’t becomin’, to hev at least three\\ncarriages to the funeral, and be sure a paper with her death in it\\nwas sent to N. Baxter, Westminster, Vermont.’\\n\\n“I faithfully obeyed her commands, put on the ugly cap myself, gave\\na party of old ladies from the home a drive in the hacks, and\\ncarefully directed a marked paper to Nathan, hoping that he HAD\\nproved ‘faithful and true.’ I didn’t expect he would, so was not\\nsurprised when no answer came. But I WAS rather amazed when Almiry\\ntold me she didn’t care to keep on with the store now she was free.\\nShe wanted to visit her friends a spell this spring, and in the fall\\nwould go back to her trade in some milliner’s store.\\n\\n“I was sorry, for I really enjoyed my partnership. It seemed a\\nlittle bit ungrateful after all my trouble in getting her customers,\\nbut I didn’t say anything, and we sold out to the Widow Bates, who\\nis a good soul with six children, and will profit by our efforts.\\n\\n“Almiry bid me good-by with all the grim look gone out of her face,\\nmany thanks, and a hearty promise to write soon. That was in April.\\nA week ago I got a short letter saying,--\\n\\n“‘DEAR FRIEND,--You will be pleased to hear that I am married to Mr.\\nBaxter, and shall remain here. He was away when the paper came with\\nmother’s death, but as soon as he got home he wrote. I couldn’t make\\nup my mind till I got home and see him. Now it’s all right, and I am\\nvery happy. Many thanks for all you done for me and mother. I shall\\nnever forget it My husband sends respects, and I remain Yours\\ngratefully, ALMIRA M. BAXTER.’”\\n\\n“That’s splendid! You did well, and next winter you can look up\\nanother sour spinster and cranky old lady and make them happy,” said\\nAnna, with the approving smile all loved to receive from her.\\n\\n“My adventures are not a bit romantic, or even interesting, and yet\\nI’ve been as busy as a bee all winter, and enjoyed my work very\\nmuch,” began Elizabeth, as the President gave her a nod.\\n\\n“The plan I had in mind was to go and carry books and papers to the\\npeople in hospitals, as one of Mamma’s friends has done for years. I\\nwent once to the City Hospital with her, and it was very\\ninteresting, but I didn’t dare to go to the grown people all alone,\\nso I went to the Children’s Hospital, and soon loved to help amuse\\nthe poor little dears. I saved all the picture-books and papers I\\ncould find for them, dressed dolls, and mended toys, and got new\\nones, and made bibs and night-gowns, and felt like the mother of a\\nlarge family.\\n\\n“I had my pets, of course, and did my best for them, reading and\\nsinging and amusing them, for many suffered very much. One little\\ngirl was so dreadfully burned she could not use her hands, and would\\nlie and look at a gay dolly tied to the bedpost by the hour\\ntogether, and talk to it and love it, and died with it on her pillow\\nwhen I ‘sung lullaby’ to her for the last time. I keep it among my\\ntreasures, for I learned a lesson in patience from little Norah that\\nI never can forget.\\n\\n“Then Jimmy Dolan with hip disease was a great delight to me, for he\\nwas as gay as a lark in spite of pain, and a real little hero in the\\nway he bore the hard things that had to be done to him. He never can\\nget well, and he is at home now; but I still see to him, and he is\\nlearning to make toy furniture very nicely, so that by and by, if he\\ngets able to work at all, he may be able to learn a cabinet-maker’s\\ntrade, or some easy work.\\n\\n“But my pet of pets was Johnny, the blind boy. His poor eyes had to\\nbe taken out, and there he was left so helpless and pathetic, all\\nhis life before him, and no one to help him, for his people were\\npoor and he had to go away from the hospital since he was incurable.\\nHe seemed almost given to me, for the first time I saw him I was\\nsinging to Jimmy, when the door opened and a small boy came fumbling\\nin.\\n\\n“‘I hear a pretty voice, I want to find it,’ he said, stopping as I\\nstopped with both hands out as if begging for more.\\n\\n“‘Come on. Johnny, and the lady will sing to you like a bobolink,’\\ncalled Jimmy, as proud as Barnum showing off Jumbo.\\n\\n“The poor little thing came and stood at my knee, without stirring,\\nwhile I sang all the nursery jingles I knew. Then he put such a thin\\nlittle finger on my lips as if to feel where the music came from,\\nand said, smiling all over his white face, ‘More, please more, lots\\nof ‘em! I love it!’\\n\\n“So I sang away till I was as hoarse as a crow, and Johnny drank it\\nall in like water; kept time with his head, stamped when I gave him\\n‘Marching through Georgia,’ and hurrahed feebly in the chorus of\\n‘Red, White, and Blue.’ It was lovely to see how he enjoyed it, and\\nI was so glad I had a voice to comfort those poor babies with. He\\ncried when I had to go, and so touched my heart that I asked all\\nabout him, and resolved to get him into the Blind School as the only\\nplace where he could be taught and made happy.”\\n\\n“I thought you were bound there the day I met you, Lizzie; but you\\nlooked as solemn as if all your friends had lost their sight,” cried\\nMarion.\\n\\n“I did feel solemn, for if Johnny could not go there he would be\\nbadly off. Fortunately he was ten, and dear Mrs. Russell helped me,\\nand those good people took him in though they were crowded. ‘We\\ncannot turn one away,’ said kind Mr. Parpatharges.\\n\\n“So there my boy is, as happy as a king with his little mates,\\nlearning all sorts of useful lessons and pretty plays. He models\\nnicely in clay. Here is one of his little works. Could you do as\\nwell without eyes?” and Lizzie proudly produced a very one-sided\\npear with a long straw for a stem. “I don’t expect he will ever be a\\nsculptor, but I hope he will do something with music he loves it so,\\nand is already piping away on a fife very cleverly. Whatever his\\ngift may prove, if he lives, he will be taught to be a useful,\\nindependent man, not a helpless burden, nor an unhappy creature\\nsitting alone in the dark. I feel very happy about my lads, and am\\nsurprised to find how well I get on with them. I shall look up some\\nmore next year, for I really think I have quite a gift that way,\\nthough you wouldn’t expect it, as I have no brothers, and always had\\na fancy boys were little imps.”\\n\\nThe girls were much amused at Lizzie’s discovery of her own powers,\\nfor she was a stately damsel, who never indulged in romps, but lived\\nfor her music. Now it was evident that she had found the key to\\nunlock childish hearts, and was learning to use it, quite\\nunconscious that the sweet voice she valued so highly was much\\nimproved by the tender tones singing lullabies gave it. The fat pear\\nwas passed round like refreshments, receiving much praise and no\\nharsh criticism; and when it was safely returned to its proud\\npossessor, Ida began her tale in a lively tone.\\n\\n“I waited for MY chore, and it came tumbling down our basement steps\\none rainy day in the shape of a large dilapidated umbrella with a\\npair of small boots below it. A mild howl made me run to open the\\ndoor, for I was at lunch in the dining-room, all alone, and rather\\nblue because I couldn’t go over to see Ella. A very small girl lay\\nwith her head in a puddle at the foot of the steps, the boots waving\\nin the air, and the umbrella brooding over her like a draggled green\\nbird.\\n\\n“‘Are you hurt, child?’ said I.\\n\\n“‘No, I thank you, ma’am,’ said the mite quite calmly, as she sat up\\nand settled a woman’s shabby black hat on her head.\\n\\n“‘Did you come begging?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘No, ma’am, I came for some things Mrs. Grover’s got for us. She\\ntold me to. I don’t beg.’ And up rose the sopping thing with great\\ndignity.\\n\\n“So I asked her to sit down, and ran up to call Mrs. Grover. She was\\nbusy with Grandpa just then, and when I went back to my lunch there\\nsat my lady with her arms folded, water dripping out of the toes of\\nher old boots as they hung down from the high chair, and the biggest\\nblue eyes I ever saw fixed upon the cake and oranges on the table. I\\ngave her a piece, and she sighed with rapture, but only picked at it\\ntill I asked if she didn’t like it.\\n\\n“‘Oh yes, ‘m, it’s elegant! Only I was wishin’ I could take it to\\nCaddy and Tot, if you didn’t mind. They never had frostin’ in all\\ntheir lives, and I did once.’\\n\\n“Of course I put up a little basket of cake and oranges and figs,\\nand while Lotty feasted, we talked. I found that their mother washed\\ndishes all day in a restaurant over by the Albany Station, leaving\\nthe three children alone in the room they have on Berry Street.\\nThink of that poor thing going off before light these winter\\nmornings to stand over horrid dishes all day long, and those three\\nscraps of children alone till night! Sometimes they had a fire, and\\nwhen they hadn’t they stayed in bed. Broken food and four dollars a\\nweek was all the woman got, and on that they tried to live. Good\\nMrs. Grover happened to be nursing a poor soul near Berry Street\\nlast summer, and used to see the three little things trailing round\\nthe streets with no one to look after them.\\n\\n“Lotty is nine, though she looks about six, but is as old as most\\ngirls of fourteen, and takes good care of ‘the babies,’ as she calls\\nthe younger ones. Mrs. Grover went to see them, and, though a\\nhard-working creature, did all she could for them. This winter she\\nhas plenty of time to sew, for Grandpapa needs little done for him\\nexcept at night and morning, and that kind woman spent her own\\nmoney, and got warm flannel and cotton and stuff, and made each\\nchild a good suit. Lotty had come for hers, and when the bundle was\\nin her arms she hugged it close, and put up her little face to kiss\\nGrover so prettily, I felt that I wanted to do something too. So I\\nhunted up Min’s old waterproof and rubbers, and a hood, and sent\\nLotty home as happy as a queen, promising to go and see her. I did\\ngo, and there was my work all ready for me. Oh, girls! such a bare,\\ncold room, without a spark of fire, and no food but a pan of bits of\\npie and bread and meat, not fit for any one to eat, and in the bed,\\nwith an old carpet for cover, lay the three children. Tot and Caddy\\ncuddled in the warmest place, while Lotty, with her little blue\\nhands, was trying to patch up some old stockings with bits of\\ncotton. I didn’t know how to begin, but Lotty did, and I just took\\nher orders; for that wise little woman told me where to buy a bushel\\nof coal and some kindlings, and milk and meal, and all I wanted. I\\nworked like a beaver for an hour or two, and was so glad I’d been to\\na cooking-class, for I could make a fire, with Lotty to do the\\ngrubby part, and start a nice soup with the cold meat and potatoes,\\nand an onion or so. Soon the room was warm, and full of a nice\\nsmell, and out of bed tumbled ‘the babies,’ to dance round the stove\\nand sniff at the soup, and drink milk like hungry kittens, till I\\ncould get bread and butter ready.\\n\\n“It was great fun! and when we had cleared things up a bit, and I’d\\nput food for supper in the closet, and told Lotty to warm a bowl of\\nsoup for her mother and keep the fire going, I went home tired and\\ndirty, but very glad I’d found something to do. It is perfectly\\namazing how little poor people’s things cost, and yet they can’t get\\nthe small amount of money needed without working themselves to\\ndeath. Why, all I bought didn’t cost more than I often spend for\\nflowers, or theatre tickets, or lunches, and it made those poor\\nbabies so comfortable I could have cried to think I’d never done it\\nbefore.”\\n\\nIda paused to shake her head remorsefully, then went on with her\\nstory, sewing busily all the while on an unbleached cotton\\nnight-gown which looked about fit for a large doll.\\n\\n“I have no romantic things to tell, for poor Mrs. Kennedy was a\\nshiftless, broken-down woman, who could only ‘sozzle round,’ as Mrs.\\nGrover said, and rub along with help from any one who would lend a\\nhand. She had lived out, married young, and had no faculty about\\nanything; so when her husband died, and she was left with three\\nlittle children, it was hard to get on, with no trade, feeble\\nhealth, and a discouraged mind. She does her best, loves the girls,\\nand works hard at the only thing she can find to do; but when she\\ngives out, they will all have to part,--she to a hospital, and the\\nbabies to some home. She dreads that, and tugs away, trying to keep\\ntogether and get ahead. Thanks to Mrs. Grover, who is very sensible,\\nand knows how to help poor people, we have made things comfortable,\\nand the winter has gone nicely.\\n\\n“The mother has got work nearer home, Lotty and Caddy go to school,\\nand Tot is safe and warm, with Miss Parsons to look after her. Miss\\nParsons is a young woman who was freezing and starving in a little\\nroom upstairs, too proud to beg and too shy and sick to get much\\nwork. I found her warming her hands one day in Mrs. Kennedy’s room,\\nand hanging over the soup-pot as if she was eating the smell. It\\nreminded me of the picture in Punch where the two beggar boys look\\nin at a kitchen, sniffing at the nice dinner cooking there. One\\nsays, ‘I don’t care for the meat, Bill, but I don’t mind if I takes\\na smell at the pudd’n’ when it’s dished.’ I proposed a lunch at\\nonce, and we all sat down, and ate soup out of yellow bowls with\\npewter spoons with such a relish it was fun to see. I had on my old\\nrig; so poor Parsons thought I was some dressmaker or work-girl, and\\nopened her heart to me as she never would have done if I’d gone and\\ndemanded her confidence, and patronized her, as some people do when\\nthey want to help. I promised her some work, and proposed that she\\nshould do it in Mrs. K.’s room, as a favor, mind you, so that the\\nolder girls could go to school and Tot have some one to look after\\nher. She agreed, and that saved her fire, and made the K.’s all\\nright. Sarah (that’s Miss P.) tried to stiffen up when she learned\\nwhere I lived; but she wanted the work, and soon found I didn’t put\\non airs, but lent her books, and brought her and Tot my bouquets and\\nfavors after a german, and told her pleasant things as she sat\\ncooking her poor chilblainy feet in the oven, as if she never could\\nget thawed out.\\n\\n“This summer the whole batch are to go to Uncle Frank’s farm and\\npick berries, and get strong. He hires dozens of women and children\\nduring the fruit season, and Mrs. Grover said it was just what they\\nall needed. So off they go in June, as merry as grigs, and I shall\\nbe able to look after them now and then, as I always go to the farm\\nin July. That’s all,--not a bit interesting, but it came to me, and\\nI did it, though only a small chore.”\\n\\n“I’m sure the helping of five poor souls is a fine work, and you may\\nwell be proud of it, Ida. Now I know why you wouldn’t go to matinees\\nwith me, and buy every pretty thing we saw as you used to. The\\npocket money went for coal and food, and your fancy work was little\\nclothes for these live dolls of yours. You dear thing! how good you\\nwere to cook, and grub, and prick your fingers rough, and give up\\nfun, for this kind work!”\\n\\nMaggie’s hearty kiss, and the faces of her friends, made Ida feel\\nthat her humble task had its worth in their eyes, as well as in her\\nown; and when the others had expressed their interest in her work,\\nall composed themselves to hear what Marion had to tell.\\n\\n“I have been taking care of a scarlet runner,--a poor old\\nfrost-bitten, neglected thing; it is transplanted now, and doing\\nwell, I’m happy to say.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Ella, while the rest looked very curious.\\n\\nMarion picked up a dropped stitch in the large blue sock she was\\nknitting, and continued, with a laugh in her eyes: “My dears, that\\nis what we call the Soldiers’ Messenger Corps, with their red caps\\nand busy legs trotting all day. I’ve had one of them to care for,\\nand a gorgeous time of it, I do assure you. But before I exult over\\nmy success, I must honestly confess my failures, for they were sad\\nones. I was so anxious to begin my work at once, that I did go out\\nand collar the first pauper I saw. It was an old man, who sometimes\\nstands at the corners of streets to sell bunches of ugly paper\\nflowers. You’ve seen him, I dare say, and his magenta daisies and\\nyellow peonies. Well, he was rather a forlorn object, with his poor\\nold red nose, and bleary eyes, and white hair, standing at the windy\\ncorners silently holding out those horrid flowers. I bought all he\\nhad that day, and gave them to some colored children on my way home,\\nand told him to come to our house and get an old coat Mamma was\\nwaiting to get rid of. He told a pitiful story of himself and his\\nold wife, who made the paper horrors in her bed, and how they needed\\neverything, but didn’t wish to beg. I was much touched, and flew\\nhome to look up the coat and some shoes, and when my old Lear came\\ncreeping in the back way, I ordered cook to give him a warm dinner\\nand something nice for the old woman.\\n\\n“I was called upstairs while he was mumbling his food, and blessing\\nme in the most lovely manner; and he went away much comforted, I\\nflattered myself. But an hour later, up came the cook in a great\\npanic to report that my venerable and pious beggar had carried off\\nseveral of Papa’s shirts and pairs of socks out of the clothes-basket\\nin the laundry, and the nice warm hood we keep for the girl to hang\\nout clothes in.\\n\\n“I was VERY angry, and, taking Harry with me, went at once to the\\naddress the old rascal gave me, a dirty court out of Hanover Street\\nNo such person had ever lived there, and my white-haired saint was a\\nhumbug. Harry laughed at me, and Mamma forbade me to bring any more\\nthieves to the house, and the girls scolded awfully.\\n\\n“Well, I recovered from the shock, and, nothing daunted, went off to\\nthe little Irishwoman who sells apples on the Common,--not the fat,\\ntosey one with the stall near West Street, but the dried-up one who\\nsits by the path, nodding over an old basket with six apples and\\nfour sticks of candy in it. No one ever seems to buy anything, but\\nshe sits there and trusts to kind souls dropping a dime now and\\nthen; she looks so feeble and forlorn, ‘on the cold, cold ground.’\\n\\n“She told me another sad tale of being all alone and unable to work,\\nand ‘as wake as wather-grewl, without a hap-worth av flesh upon me\\nbones, and for the love of Heaven gimme a thrifle to kape the breath\\nav loife in a poor soul, with a bitter hard winter over me, and\\nniver a chick or child to do a hand’s turn.’ I hadn’t much faith in\\nher, remembering my other humbug, but I did pity the old mummy; so I\\ngot some tea and sugar, and a shawl, and used to give her my odd\\npennies as I passed. I never told at home, they made such fun of my\\nefforts to be charitable. I thought I really was getting on pretty\\nwell after a time, as my old Biddy seemed quite cheered up, and I\\nwas planning to give her some coal, when she disappeared all of a\\nsudden. I feared she was ill, and asked Mrs. Maloney, the fat woman,\\nabout her.\\n\\n“‘Lord love ye, Miss dear, it’s tuk up and sint to the Island for\\ntree months she is; for a drunken ould crayther is Biddy Ryan, and\\nniver a cint but goes for whiskey,--more shame to her, wid a fine\\nbye av her own ready to kape her daycint.’\\n\\n“Then I WAS discouraged, and went home to fold my hands, and see\\nwhat fate would send me, my own efforts being such failures.”\\n\\n“Poor thing, it WAS hard luck!” said Elizabeth, as they sobered down\\nafter the gale of merriment caused by Marion’s mishaps, and her\\nclever imitation of the brogue.\\n\\n“Now tell of your success, and the scarlet runner,” added Maggie.\\n\\n“Ah! that was SENT, and so I prospered. I must begin ever so far\\nback, in war times, or I can’t introduce my hero properly. You know\\nPapa was in the army, and fought all through the war till\\nGettysburg, where he was wounded. He was engaged just before he\\nwent; so when his father hurried to him after that awful battle,\\nMamma went also, and helped nurse him till he could come home. He\\nwouldn’t go to an officer’s hospital, but kept with his men in a\\npoor sort of place, for many of his boys were hit, and he wouldn’t\\nleave them. Sergeant Joe Collins was one of the bravest, and lost\\nhis right arm saving the flag in one of the hottest struggles of\\nthat great fight. He had been a Maine lumberman, and was over six\\nfeet tall, but as gentle as a child, and as jolly as a boy, and very\\nfond of his colonel.\\n\\n“Papa left first, but made Joe promise to let him know how he got\\non, and Joe did so till he too went home. Then Papa lost sight of\\nhim, and in the excitement of his own illness, and the end of the\\nwar, and being married, Joe Collins was forgotten, till we children\\ncame along, and used to love to hear the story of Papa’s battles,\\nand how the brave sergeant caught the flag when the bearer was shot,\\nand held it in the rush till one arm was blown off and the other\\nwounded. We have fighting blood in us, you know, so we were never\\ntired of that story, though twenty-five years or more make it all\\nas far away to us as the old Revolution, where OUR ancestor was\\nkilled, at OUR Bunker Hill!\\n\\n“Last December, just after my sad disappointments, Papa came home to\\ndinner one day, exclaiming, in great glee: ‘I’ve found old Joe! A\\nmessenger came with a letter to me, and when I looked up to give my\\nanswer, there stood a tall, grizzled fellow, as straight as a\\nramrod, grinning from ear to ear, with his hand to his temple,\\nsaluting me in regular style. “Don’t you remember Joe Collins,\\nColonel? Awful glad to see you, sir,” said he. And then it all came\\nback, and we had a good talk, and I found out that the poor old boy\\nwas down on his luck, and almost friendless, but as proud and\\nindependent as ever, and bound to take care of himself while he had\\na leg to stand on. I’ve got his address, and mean to keep an eye on\\nhim, for he looks feeble and can’t make much, I’m sure.’\\n\\n“We were all very glad, and Joe came to see us, and Papa sent him on\\nendless errands, and helped him in that way till he went to New\\nYork. Then, in the fun and flurry of the holidays, we forgot all\\nabout Joe, till Papa came home and missed him from his post. I said\\nI’d go and find him; so Harry and I rummaged about till we did find\\nhim, in a little house at the North End, laid up with rheumatic\\nfever in a stuffy back room, with no one to look after him but the\\nwasherwoman with whom he boarded.\\n\\n“I was SO sorry we had forgotten him! but HE never complained, only\\nsaid, with his cheerful grin,’ I kinder mistrusted the Colonel was\\naway, but I wasn’t goin’ to pester him.’ He tried to be jolly,\\nthough in dreadful pain; called Harry ‘Major,’ and was so grateful\\nfor all we brought him, though he didn’t want oranges and tea, and\\nmade us shout when I said, like a goose, thinking that was the\\nproper thing to do, ‘Shall I bathe your brow, you are so feverish?’\\n\\n“‘No, thanky, miss, it was swabbed pretty stiddy to the horsepittle,\\nand I reckon a trifle of tobaccer would do more good and be a sight\\nmore relishin’, ef you’ll excuse my mentionin’ it.’\\n\\n“Harry rushed off and got a great lump and a pipe, and Joe lay\\nblissfully puffing, in a cloud of smoke, when we left him, promising\\nto come again. We did go nearly every day, and had lovely times; for\\nJoe told us his adventures, and we got so interested in the war that\\nI began to read up evenings, and Papa was pleased, and fought all\\nhis battles over again for us, and Harry and I were great friends\\nreading together, and Papa was charmed to see the old General’s\\nspirit in us, as we got excited and discussed all our wars in a\\nfever of patriotism that made Mamma laugh. Joe said I ‘brustled up’\\nat the word BATTLE like a war-horse at the smell of powder, and I’d\\nought to have been a drummer, the sound of martial music made me so\\n‘skittish.’\\n\\n“It was all new and charming to us young ones, but poor old Joe had\\na hard time, and was very ill. Exposure and fatigue, and scanty\\nfood, and loneliness, and his wounds, were too much for him, and it\\nwas plain his working days were over. He hated the thought of the\\npoor-house at home, which was all his own town could offer him, and\\nhe had no friends to live with, and he could not get a pension,\\nsomething being wrong about his papers; so he would have been badly\\noff, but for the Soldiers’ Home at Chelsea. As soon as he was able,\\nPapa got him in there, and he was glad to go, for that seemed the\\nproper place, and a charity the proudest man might accept, after\\nrisking his life for his country.\\n\\n“There is where I used to be going when you saw me, and I was SO\\nafraid you’d smell the cigars in my basket. The dear old boys always\\nwant them, and Papa says they MUST have them, though it isn’t half\\nso romantic as flowers, and jelly, and wine, and the dainty messes\\nwe women always want to carry. I’ve learned about different kinds of\\ntobacco and cigars, and you’d laugh to see me deal out my gifts,\\nwhich are received as gratefully as the Victoria Cross, when the\\nQueen decorates HER brave men. I’m quite a great gun over there, and\\nthe boys salute when I come, tell me their woes, and think that Papa\\nand I can run the whole concern. I like it immensely, and am as\\nproud and fond of my dear old wrecks as if I’d been a Rigoletto, and\\nridden on a cannon from my babyhood. That’s MY story, but I can’t\\nbegin to tell how interesting it all is, nor how glad I am that it\\nled me to look into the history of American wars, in which brave men\\nof our name did their parts so well.”\\n\\nA hearty round of applause greeted Marion’s tale, for her glowing\\nface and excited voice stirred the patriotic spirit of the Boston\\ngirls, and made them beam approvingly upon her.\\n\\n“Now, Maggie, dear, last but not least, I’m sure,” said Anna, with\\nan encouraging glance, for SHE had discovered the secret of this\\nfriend, and loved her more than ever for it.\\n\\nMaggie blushed and hesitated, as she put down the delicate muslin\\ncap-strings she was hemming with such care. Then, looking about her\\nwith a face in which both humility and pride contended, she said\\nwith an effort, “After the other lively experiences, mine will sound\\nvery flat. In fact, I have no story to tell, for MY charity began at\\nhome, and stopped there.”\\n\\n“Tell it, dear. I know it is interesting, and will do us all good,”\\n said Anna, quickly; and, thus supported, Maggie went on.\\n\\n“I planned great things, and talked about what I meant to do, till\\nPapa said one day, when things were in a mess, as they often are at\\nour house, ‘If the little girls who want to help the world along\\nwould remember that charity begins at home, they would soon find\\nenough to do.’\\n\\n“I was rather taken aback, and said no more, but after Papa had gone\\nto the office, I began to think, and looked round to see what there\\nwas to be done at that particular moment. I found enough for that\\nday, and took hold at once; for poor Mamma had one of her bad\\nheadaches, the children could not go out because it rained, and so\\nwere howling in the nursery, cook was on a rampage, and Maria had\\nthe toothache. Well, I began by making Mamma lie down for a good\\nlong sleep. I kept the children quiet by giving them my ribbon box\\nand jewelry to dress up with, put a poultice on Maria’s face, and\\noffered to wash the glass and silver for her, to appease cook, who\\nwas as cross as two sticks over extra work washing-day. It wasn’t\\nmuch fun, as you may imagine, but I got through the afternoon, and\\nkept the house still, and at dusk crept into Mamma’s room and softly\\nbuilt up the fire, so it should be cheery when she waked. Then I\\nwent trembling to the kitchen for some tea, and there found three\\ngirls calling, and high jinks going on; for one whisked a plate of\\ncake into the table drawer, another put a cup under her shawl, and\\ncook hid the teapot, as I stirred round in the china closet before\\nopening the slide, through a crack of which I’d seen, heard, and\\nsmelt ‘the party,’ as the children call it.\\n\\n“I was angry enough to scold the whole set, but I wisely held my\\ntongue, shut my eyes, and politely asked for some hot water, nodded\\nto the guests, and told cook Maria was better, and would do her work\\nif she wanted to go out.\\n\\n“So peace reigned, and as I settled the tray, I heard cook say in\\nher balmiest tone, for I suspect the cake and tea lay heavy on her\\nconscience, ‘The mistress is very poorly, and Miss takes nice care\\nof her, the dear.’\\n\\n“All blarney, but it pleased me and made me remember how feeble poor\\nMamma was, and how little I really did. So I wept a repentant weep\\nas I toiled upstairs with my tea and toast, and found Mamma all\\nready for them, and so pleased to find things going well. I saw by\\nthat what a relief it would be to her if I did it oftener, as I\\nought, and as I resolved that I would.\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything, but I kept on doing whatever came along, and\\nbefore I knew it ever so many duties slipped out of Mamma’s hands\\ninto mine, and seemed to belong to me. I don’t mean that I liked\\nthem, and didn’t grumble to myself; I did, and felt regularly\\ncrushed and injured sometimes when I wanted to go and have my own\\nfun. Duty is right, but it isn’t easy, and the only comfort about it\\nis a sort of quiet feeling you get after a while, and a strong\\nfeeling, as if you’d found something to hold on to and keep you\\nsteady. I can’t express it, but you know?” And Maggie looked\\nwistfully at the other faces, some of which answered her with a\\nquick flash of sympathy, and some only wore a puzzled yet respectful\\nexpression, as if they felt they ought to know, but did not.\\n\\n“I need not tire you with all my humdrum doings,” continued Maggie.\\n“I made no plans, but just said each day, ‘I’ll take what comes,\\nand try to be cheerful and contented.’ So I looked after the\\nchildren, and that left Maria more time to sew and help round. I did\\nerrands, and went to market, and saw that Papa had his meals\\ncomfortably when Mamma was not able to come down. I made calls for\\nher, and received visitors, and soon went on as if I were the lady\\nof the house, not ‘a chit of a girl,’ as Cousin Tom used to call me.\\n\\n“The best of all were the cosey talks we had in the twilight, Mamma\\nand I, when she was rested, and all the day’s worry was over, and we\\nwere waiting for Papa. Now, when he came, I didn’t have to go away,\\nfor they wanted to ask and tell me things, and consult about\\naffairs, and make me feel that I was really the eldest daughter. Oh,\\nit was just lovely to sit between them and know that they needed me,\\nand loved to have me with them! That made up for the hard and\\ndisagreeable things, and not long ago I got my reward. Mamma is\\nbetter, and I was rejoicing over it, when she said,’ Yes, I really\\nam mending now, and hope soon to be able to relieve my good girl.\\nBut I want to tell you, dear, that when I was most discouraged my\\ngreatest comfort was, that if I had to leave my poor babies they\\nwould find such a faithful little mother in you.’\\n\\n“I was SO pleased I wanted to cry, for the children DO love me, and\\nrun to me for everything now, and think the world of Sister, and\\nthey didn’t use to care much for me. But that wasn’t all. I ought\\nnot to tell these things, perhaps, but I’m so proud of them I can’t\\nhelp it. When I asked Papa privately, if Mamma was REALLY better and\\nin no danger of falling ill again, he said, with his arms round me,\\nand such a tender kiss,--\\n\\n“‘No danger now, for this brave little girl put her shoulder to the\\nwheel so splendidly, that the dear woman got the relief from care\\nshe needed just at the right time, and now she really rests sure\\nthat we are not neglected. You couldn’t have devoted yourself to a\\nbetter charity, or done it more sweetly, my darling. God bless\\nyou!’”\\n\\nHere Maggie’s voice gave out, and she hid her face, with a happy\\nsob, that finished her story eloquently. Marion flew to wipe her\\ntears away with the blue sock, and the others gave a sympathetic\\nmurmur, looking much touched; forgotten duties of their own rose\\nbefore them, and sudden resolutions were made to attend to them at\\nonce, seeing how great Maggie’s reward had been.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be silly; but I wanted you to know that I hadn’t\\nbeen idle all winter, and that, though I haven’t much to tell, I’m\\nquite satisfied with my chore,” she said, looking up with smiles\\nshining through the tears till her face resembled a rose in a\\nsun-shower.\\n\\n“Many daughters have done well, but thou excellest them all,”\\n answered Anna, with a kiss that completed her satisfaction.\\n\\n“Now, as it is after our usual time, and we must break up,”\\n continued the President, producing a basket of flowers from its\\nhiding-place, “I will merely say that I think we have all learned a\\ngood deal, and will be able to work better next winter; for I am\\nsure we shall want to try again, it adds so much sweetness to our\\nown lives to put even a little comfort into the hard lives of the\\npoor. As a farewell token, I sent for some real Plymouth mayflowers,\\nand here they are, a posy apiece, with my love and many thanks for\\nyour help in carrying out my plan so beautifully.”\\n\\nSo the nosegays were bestowed, the last lively chat enjoyed, new\\nplans suggested, and goodbyes said; then the club separated, each\\nmember going gayly away with the rosy flowers on her bosom, and in\\nit a clearer knowledge of the sad side of life, a fresh desire to\\nsee and help still more, and a sweet satisfaction in the thought\\nthat each had done what she could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN IVY SPRAY AND LADIES’ SLIPPERS\\n\\n\\n“IT can’t be done! So I may as well give it I up and get a new pair.\\nI long for them, but I’m afraid my nice little plan for Laura will\\nbe spoilt,” said Jessie Delano to herself, as she shook her head\\nover a pair of small, dilapidated slippers almost past mending.\\nWhile she vainly pricked her fingers over them for the last time,\\nher mind was full of girlish hopes and fears, as well as of\\nanxieties far too serious for a light-hearted creature of sixteen.\\n\\nA year ago the sisters had been the petted daughters of a rich man;\\nbut death and misfortune came suddenly, and now they were left to\\nface poverty alone. They had few relations, and had offended the\\nrich uncle who offered Jessie a home, because she refused to be\\nseparated from her sister. Poor Laura was an invalid, and no one\\nwanted her; but Jessie would not leave her, so they clung together\\nand lived on in the humble rooms where their father died, trying to\\nearn their bread by the only accomplishments they possessed. Laura\\npainted well, and after many disappointments was beginning to find a\\nsale for her dainty designs and delicate flowers. Jessie had a\\nnatural gift for dancing; and her former teacher, a kind-hearted\\nFrenchwoman, offered her favorite pupil the post of assistant\\nteacher in her classes for children.\\n\\nIt cost the girl a struggle to accept a place of this sort and be a\\nhumble teacher, patiently twirling stupid little boys and girls\\nround and round over the smooth floor where she used to dance so\\nhappily when she was the pride of the class and the queen of the\\nclosing balls. But for Laura’s sake she gratefully accepted the\\noffer, glad to add her mite to their small store, and to feel that\\nshe could help keep the wolf from the door. They had seemed to hear\\nthe howl of this dreaded phantom more than once during that year,\\nand looked forward to the long hard winter with an anxiety which\\nneither would confess to the other. Laura feared to fall ill if she\\nworked too hard, and then what would become of this pretty young\\nsister who loved her so tenderly and would not be tempted to leave\\nher? And Jessie could do very little except rebel against their hard\\nfate and make impracticable plans. But each worked bravely, talked\\ncheerfully, and waited hopefully for some good fortune to befall\\nthem, while doubt and pain and poverty and care made the young\\nhearts so heavy that the poor girls often fell asleep on pillows wet\\nwith secret tears.\\n\\nThe smaller trials of life beset Jessie at this particular moment,\\nand her bright wits were trying to solve the problem how to spend\\nher treasured five dollars on slippers for herself and paints for\\nLaura. Both were much needed, and she had gone in shabby shoes to\\nsave up money for the little surprise on which she had set her\\nheart; but now dismay fell upon her when the holes refused to be\\ncobbled, and the largest of bows would not hide the worn-out toes in\\nspite of ink and blacking lavishly applied.\\n\\n“These are the last of my dear French slippers, and I can’t afford\\nany more. I hate cheap things! But I shall have to get them; for my\\nboots are shabby, and every one has to look at my feet when I lead.\\nOh dear, what a horrid thing it is to be poor!” and Jessie surveyed\\nthe shabby little shoes affectionately, as her eyes filled with\\ntears; for the road looked very rough and steep now, when she\\nremembered how she used to dance through life as happy as a\\nbutterfly in a garden full of sunshine and flowers.\\n\\n“Now, Jess, no nonsense, no red eyes to tell tales! Go and do your\\nerrands, and come in as gay as a lark, or Laura will be worried.”\\n And springing up, the girl began to sing instead of sob, as she\\nstirred about her dismal little room, cleaning her old gloves,\\nmending her one white dress, and wishing with a sigh of intense\\nlonging that she could afford some flowers to wear, every ornament\\nhaving been sold long ago. Then, with a kiss and a smile to her\\npatient sister, she hurried away to get the necessary slippers and\\nthe much-desired paints, which Laura would not ask for, though her\\nwork waited for want of them.\\n\\nHaving been reared in luxury, poor little Jessie’s tastes were all\\nof the daintiest sort; and her hardest trial, after Laura’s feeble\\nhealth, was the daily sacrifice of the many comforts and elegances\\nto which she had been accustomed. Faded gowns, cleaned gloves, and\\nmended boots cost her many a pang, and the constant temptation of\\nseeing pretty, useful, and unattainable things was a very hard one.\\nLaura rarely went out, and so was spared this cross; then she was\\nthree years older, had always been delicate, and lived much in a\\nhappy world of her own. So Jessie bore her trials silently, but\\nsometimes felt very covetous and resentful to see so much pleasure,\\nmoney, and beauty in the world, and yet have so little of it fall to\\nher lot.\\n\\n“I feel as if I could pick a pocket to-day and not mind a bit, if it\\nwere a rich person’s. It’s a shame, when papa was always so\\ngenerous, that no one remembers us. If ever I’m rich again, I’ll\\njust hunt up all the poor girls I can find, and give them nice\\nshoes, if nothing else,” she thought, as she went along the crowded\\nstreets, pausing involuntarily at the shop windows to look with\\nlonging eyes at the treasures within.\\n\\nResisting the allurements of French slippers with bows and buckles,\\nshe wisely bought a plain, serviceable pair, and trudged away,\\nfinding balm for her wounds in the fact that they were very cheap.\\nMore balm came when she met a young friend, who joined her as she\\nstood wistfully eying the piles of grapes in a window and longing to\\nbuy some for Laura.\\n\\nThis warm-hearted schoolmate read the wish before Jessie saw her,\\nand gratified it so adroitly that the girl could accept the pretty\\nbasketful sent to her sister without feeling like a spendthrift or a\\nbeggar. It comforted her very much, and the world began to look\\nbrighter after that little touch of kindness, as it always does when\\ngenuine sympathy makes sunshine in shady places.\\n\\nAt the art store she was told that more of Laura’s autumn-flowers\\nwere in demand; and her face was so full of innocent delight and\\ngratitude it quite touched the old man who sold her the paints, and\\ngave her more than her money’s worth, remembering his own hard times\\nand pitying the pretty young girl whose father he had known.\\n\\nSo Jessie did not have to pretend very hard at being “as gay as a\\nlark” when she got home and showed her treasures. Laura was so happy\\nover the unexpected gifts that the dinner of bread and milk and\\ngrapes was quite a picnic; and Jessie found a smile on her face when\\nshe went to dress for her party.\\n\\nIt was only a child’s party at the house of one of Mademoiselle’s\\npupils, and Jessie was merely invited to help the little people\\nthrough their dancing. She did not like to go in this way, as she\\nwas sure to meet familiar faces there, full of the pity, curiosity,\\nor indifference so hard for a girl to bear. But Mademoiselle asked\\nit as a favor, and Jessie was grateful; so she went, expecting no\\npleasure and certain of much weariness, if not annoyance.\\n\\nWhen she was ready,--and it did not take long to slip on the white\\nwoollen dress, brush out the curly dark hair, and fold up slippers\\nand gloves,--she stood before her glass looking at herself, quite\\nconscious that she was very pretty, with her large eyes, blooming\\ncheeks, and the lofty little air which nothing could change. She was\\nalso painfully conscious that her dress was neither fresh nor\\nbecoming without a bit of ribbon or a knot of flowers to give it the\\ntouch of color it needed. She had an artistic eye, and used to\\ndelight in ordering charming costumes for herself in the happy days\\nwhen all her wishes were granted as if fairies still lived. She\\ntossed over her very small store of ribbons in vain; everything had\\nbeen worn till neither beauty nor freshness remained.\\n\\n“Oh dear! where CAN I find something to make me look less like a\\nnun,--and a very shabby one, too?” she said, longing for the pink\\ncorals she sold to pay Laura’s doctor’s bill.\\n\\nThe sound of a soft tap, tap, tap, startled her, and she ran to open\\nthe door. No one was there but Laura, fast asleep on the sofa. Tap,\\ntap, tap! went the invisible hand; and as the sound seemed to come\\nfrom the window, Jessie glanced that way, thinking her tame dove had\\ncome to be fed. Neither hungry dove nor bold sparrow appeared,--only\\na spray of Japanese ivy waving in the wind. A very pretty spray it\\nwas, covered with tiny crimson leaves; and it tapped impatiently, as\\nif it answered her question by saying, “Here is a garland for you;\\ncome and take it.”\\n\\nJessie’s quick eye was caught at once by the fine color, and running\\nto the window she looked out as eagerly as if a new idea had come\\ninto her head. It was a dull November day, and the prospect of\\nsheds, ash-barrels, and old brooms was a gloomy one; but the whole\\nback of the house glowed with the red tendrils of the hardy vine\\nthat clung to and covered the dingy bricks with a royal mantle, as\\nif eager to cheer the eyes and hearts of all who looked. It preached\\na little sermon of courage, aspiration, and content to those who had\\nthe skill to read it, and bade them see how, springing from the\\nscanty soil of that back yard full of the commonest objects, the\\nhumblest work, it set its little creepers in the crannies of the\\nstone, and struggled up to find the sun and air, till it grew strong\\nand beautiful,--making the blank wall green in summer, glorious in\\nautumn, and a refuge in winter, when it welcomed the sparrows to the\\nshelter of its branches where the sun lay warmest.\\n\\nJessie loved this beautiful neighbor, and had enjoyed it all that\\nsummer,--the first she ever spent in the hot city. She felt the\\ngrace its greenness gave to all it touched, and half unconsciously\\nimitated it in trying to be brave and bright, as she also climbed up\\nfrom the dismal place where she seemed shut away from everything\\nlovely, till she was beginning to discover that the blue sky was\\nover all, the sun still shone for her, and heaven’s fresh air kissed\\nher cheeks as kindly as ever. Many a night she had leaned from the\\nhigh window when Laura was asleep, dreaming innocent dreams, living\\nover her short past, or trying to look into the future bravely and\\ntrustfully. The little vine had felt warmer drops than rain or dew\\nfall on it when things went badly, had heard whispered prayers when\\nthe lonely child asked the Father of the fatherless for help and\\ncomfort, had peeped in to see her sleeping peacefully when the hard\\nhour was over, and been the first to greet her with a tap on the\\nwindow-pane as she woke full of new hope in the morning. It seemed\\nto know all her moods and troubles, to be her friend and confidante,\\nand now came with help like a fairy godmother when our Cinderella\\nwanted to be fine for the little ball.\\n\\n“Just the thing! Why didn’t I think of it? So bright and delicate\\nand becoming? It will last better than flowers; and no one can think\\nI’m extravagant, since it costs nothing.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Jessie was gathering long sprays of the rosy vine,\\nwith its glossy leaves so beautifully shaded that it was evident\\nJack Frost had done his best for it. Going to her glass, she\\nfastened a wreath of the smallest leaves about her head, set a\\ncluster of larger ones in her bosom, and then surveyed herself with\\ngirlish pleasure, as well she might; for the effect of the simple\\ndecoration was charming. Quite satisfied now, she tied on her cloud\\nand slipped away without waking Laura, little dreaming what good\\nfortune the ivy spray was to bring them both.\\n\\nShe found the children prancing with impatience to begin their\\nballet, much excited by the music, gaslight, and gay dresses, which\\nmade it seem like “a truly ball.” All welcomed Jessie, and she soon\\nforgot the cheap slippers, mended gloves, and old dress, as she\\ngayly led her troop through the pretty dance with so much grace and\\nskill that the admiring mammas who lined the walls declared it was\\nthe sweetest thing they ever saw.\\n\\n“Who is that little person?” asked one of the few gentlemen who\\nhovered about the doorways.\\n\\nHis hostess told Jessie’s story in a few words, and was surprised to\\nhear him say in a satisfied tone,--\\n\\n“I’m glad she is poor. I want her head, and now there is some chance\\nof getting it.”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Vane, what DO you mean?” asked the lady, laughing.\\n\\n“I came to study young faces; I want one for a picture, and that\\nlittle girl with the red leaves is charming. Please present me.”\\n\\n“No use; you may ask for her hand by-and-by, if you like, but not\\nfor her head. She is very proud, and never would consent to sit as a\\nmodel, I’m sure.”\\n\\n“I think I can manage it, if you will kindly give me a start.”\\n\\n“Very well. The children are just going down to supper, and Miss\\nDelano will rest. You can make your bold proposal now, if you dare.”\\n\\nA moment later, as she stood watching the little ones troop away,\\nJessie found herself bowing to the tall gentleman, who begged to\\nknow what he could bring her with as much interest as if she had\\nbeen the finest lady in the room. Of course she chose ice-cream, and\\nslipped into a corner to rest her tired feet, preferring the\\ndeserted parlor to the noisy dining-room,--not being quite sure\\nwhere she belonged now.\\n\\nMr. Vane brought her a salver full of the dainties girls best love,\\nand drawing up a table began to eat and talk in such a simple,\\ncomfortable way that Jessie could not feel shy, but was soon quite\\nat her ease. She knew that he was a famous artist, and longed to\\ntell him about poor Laura, who admired his pictures so much and\\nwould have enjoyed every moment of this chance interview. He was not\\na very young man, nor a handsome one, but he had a genial face, and\\nthe friendly manners which are so charming; and in ten minutes\\nJessie was chatting freely, quite unconscious that the artist was\\nstudying her in a mirror all the while. They naturally talked of the\\nchildren, and after praising the pretty dance Mr. Vane quietly\\nadded,--\\n\\n“I’ve been trying--to find a face among them for a picture I’m\\ndoing; but the little dears are all too young, and I must look\\nelsewhere for a model for my wood-nymph.”\\n\\n“Are models hard to find?” asked Jessie, eating her ice with the\\nrelish of a girl who does not often taste it.\\n\\n“What I want is very hard to find. I can get plenty of beggar-girls,\\nbut this must be a refined face, young and blooming, but with poetry\\nin it; and that does not come without a different training from any\\nmy usual models get. It will be difficult to suit me, for I’m in a\\nhurry and don’t know where to look,”--which last sentence was not\\nquite true, for the long glass showed him exactly what he wanted.\\n\\n“I help Mademoiselle with her classes, and she has pupils of all\\nages; perhaps you could find some one there.”\\n\\nJessie looked so interested that the artist felt that he had begun\\nwell, and ventured a step further as he passed the cake-basket for\\nthe third time.\\n\\n“You are very kind; but the trouble there is, that I fear none of\\nthe young ladies would consent to sit to me if I dared to ask them.\\nI will confide to you that I HAVE seen a head which quite suits me;\\nbut I fear I cannot get it. Give me your advice, please. Should you\\nthink this pretty creature would be offended, if I made the request\\nmost respectfully?”\\n\\n“No, indeed; I should think she would be proud to help with one of\\nyour pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; and we\\nkept one of them when we had to sell all the rest,” said Jessie, in\\nher eager, frank way.\\n\\n“That was a beautiful compliment, and I am proud of it. Please tell\\nher so, with my thanks. Which was it?”\\n\\n“The woman’s head,--the sad, sweet one people call a Madonna. We\\ncall it Mother, and love it very much, for Laura says it is like our\\nmother. I never saw her, but my sister remembers the dear face very\\nwell.”\\n\\nJessie’s eyes dropped, as if tears were near; and Mr. Vane said, in\\na voice which showed he understood and shared her feeling,--\\n\\n“I am very glad that anything of mine has been a comfort to you. I\\nthought of my own mother when I painted that picture years ago; so\\nyou see you read it truly, and gave it the right name. Now, about\\nthe other head; you think I may venture to propose the idea to its\\nowner, do you?”\\n\\n“Why not, sir? She would be very silly to refuse, I think.”\\n\\n“Then YOU wouldn’t be offended if asked to sit in this way?”\\n\\n“Oh, no. I’ve sat for Laura many a time, and she says I make a very\\ngood model. But then, she only paints simple little things that I am\\nfit for.”\\n\\n“That is just what I want to do. Would you mind asking the young\\nlady for me? She is just behind you.”\\n\\nJessie turned with a start, wondering who had come in; but all she\\nsaw was her own curious face in the mirror, and Mr. Vane’s smiling\\none above it.\\n\\n“Do you mean me?” she cried, so surprised and pleased and half\\nashamed that she could only blush and laugh and look prettier than\\never.\\n\\n“Indeed I do. Mrs. Murray thought the request would annoy you; but I\\nfancied you would grant it, you wore such a graceful little garland,\\nand seemed so interested in the pictures here.”\\n\\n“It is only a bit of ivy, but so pretty I wanted to wear it, as I\\nhad nothing else,” said the girl, glad that her simple ornament\\nfound favor in such eyes.\\n\\n“It is most artistic, and caught my eye at once. I said to myself,’\\nThat is the head I want, and I MUST secure it if possible.’ Can I?”\\n asked Mr. Vane, smiling persuasively as he saw what a frank and\\nartless young person he had to deal with.\\n\\n“With pleasure, if Laura doesn’t mind. I’ll ask her, and if she is\\nwilling I shall be very proud to have even my wreath in a famous\\npicture,” answered Jessie, so full of innocent delight at being thus\\nhonored that it was a pretty sight to see.\\n\\n“A thousand thanks! Now I can exult over Mrs. Murray, and get my\\npalette ready. When can we begin? As your sister is an invalid and\\ncannot come to my studio with you, perhaps you will allow me to make\\nmy sketch at your own house,” said Mr. Vane, as pleased with his\\nsuccess as only a perplexed artist could be.\\n\\n“Did Mrs. Murray tell you about us?” asked Jessie quickly, as her\\nsmiles faded away and the proud look came into her face; for she was\\nsure their misfortunes were known, since he spoke of poor Laura’s\\nhealth.\\n\\n“A little,” began the new friend, with a sympathetic glance.\\n\\n“I know models are paid for sitting; did you wish to do it with me\\nbecause I’m poor?” asked Jessie, with an irrepressible frown and a\\nglance at the thrice-cleaned dress and the neatly mended gloves.\\n\\nMr. Vane knew what thorn pricked the sensitive little girl, and\\nanswered in his friendliest tone,--\\n\\n“I never thought of such a thing. I wanted YOU to help ME, because I\\nam poor in what artists so much need,--real grace and beauty. I\\nhoped you would allow me to give your sister a copy of the sketch as\\na token of my gratitude for your great kindness.”\\n\\nThe frown vanished and the smile returned as the soft answer turned\\naway Jessie’s wrath and made her hasten to say penitently,--\\n\\n“I was very rude; but I haven’t learned to be humble yet, and often\\nforget that I am poor. Please come to us any time. Laura will enjoy\\nseeing you work, and be delighted with anything you give her. So\\nshall I, though I don’t deserve it.”\\n\\n“I won’t punish you by painting the frown that quite frightened me\\njust now, but do my best to keep the happy face, and so heap coals\\nof fire on your head. They won’t burn any more than the pretty red\\nleaves that brought me this good fortune,” answered the artist,\\nseeing that his peace was made.\\n\\n“I’m SO glad I wore them!” and as if trying to make amends for her\\nlittle flash of temper, Jessie told him about the ivy, and how she\\nloved it,--unconsciously betraying more of her pathetic little story\\nthan she knew, and increasing her hearer’s interest in his new\\nmodel.\\n\\nThe children came back in riotous spirits, and Jessie was called to\\nlead the revels again. But now her heart was as light as her heels;\\nfor she had something pleasant to think of,--a hope of help for\\nLaura, and the memory of kind words to make hard duties easier. Mr.\\nVane soon slipped away, promising to come the next day; and at eight\\no’clock Jessie ran home to tell her sister the good news, and to\\npress the little wreath which had served her so well.\\n\\nWith the sanguine spirit of girlhood, she felt sure that something\\ndelightful would happen, and built fine castles in the air for her\\nsister, with a small corner for herself, where she could watch Laura\\nbloom into a healthy woman and a great artist. The desire of\\nJessie’s heart was to earn eneugh money to enable them to spend a\\nmonth or two at the seashore when summer came, as that was the\\nsurest cure for Laura’s weak nerves and muscles. She had cherished\\nthe wild idea of being a ballet-girl, as dancing was her delight;\\nbut every one frowned upon that plan, and her own refined nature\\ntold her that it was not the life for a young girl. Mr. Vane’s\\nrequest for her head suggested a splendid hope; and after getting\\nangry with him for hinting at her being a model, she suddenly\\ndecided to try it,--with the charming inconsistency of her sex. The\\nmore she thought of it, the better she liked the idea, and resolved\\nto ask her new friend all about it, fondly hoping that much money\\ncould be made in this way.\\n\\nShe said nothing to her sister, but while she sat patiently to Mr.\\nVane when he came next day, she asked many questions; and though\\nsomewhat discouraged by his replies, confided to him her hopes and\\nbegged his advice. Being a wise man as well as a good and kindly\\none, he saw at once that this life would not be safe for the pretty,\\nimpulsive, and tenderly reared girl, left so unprotected in a world\\nfull of trials and temptations. So he told her it would not do,\\nexcept so far as she would allow him to make several studies of her\\nhead in various characters and pay for them.\\n\\nShe consented, and though much disappointed found some consolation\\nin hoarding a part of the handsome sum so earned for the desire of\\nher heart.\\n\\nThe artist seemed in no haste to finish his work, and for some weeks\\ncame often to the sittings in that quiet room; for it grew more and\\nmore attractive to him, and while he painted the younger sister’s\\nchangeful face he studied the beautiful nature of the elder and\\nlearned to love it. But no one guessed that secret for a long time;\\nand Jessie was so busy racking her brain for a way to earn more\\nmoney that she was as blind and deaf to much that went on before her\\nas if she had been a wooden dummy.\\n\\nSuddenly, when she least expected it, help came, and in such a\\ndelightful way that she long remembered the little episode with\\ngirlish satisfaction. One day as she sat wearily waiting till the\\ndressing-room was cleared of maids and children after the\\ndancing-class was over, a former friend came sauntering up to her,\\nsaying In the tone which always nettled Jessie,--\\n\\n“You poor thing! aren’t you tired to death trying to teach these\\nstupid babies?”\\n\\n“No; I love to dance, and we had new figures to-day. See! isn’t this\\npretty?” and Jessie, who knew her own skill and loved to display it,\\ntwirled away as lightly as if her feet were not aching with two\\nhours of hard work.\\n\\n“Lovely! I do wish I ever could learn to keep time and not jerk and\\nbounce. Being plump is a dreadful trial,” sighed Fanny Fletcher, as\\nJessie came back beaming and breathless.\\n\\n“Perhaps I can teach you. I think of making this my profession since\\nI must do something. Mademoiselle earns heaps of money by it,” she\\nsaid, sitting down to rest, resolved not to be ashamed of her work\\nor to let Fanny pity her.\\n\\n“I wish you COULD teach me, for I know I shall disgrace myself at\\nthe Kirmess. You’ve heard about it, of course? So sorry you can’t\\ntake a part, for it’s going to be great fun and very splendid. I am\\nin the Hungarian dance, and it’s one of the hardest; but the dress\\nis lovely, and I would be in it. Mamma is the matron of it; so I had\\nmy way, though I know the girls don’t want me, and the boys make fun\\nof me. Just see if this isn’t the queerest step you ever beheld!”\\n\\nFanny started bravely across the wide smooth floor, with a stamp, a\\nslide, and a twirl which was certainly odd, but might have been\\nlively and graceful if she had not unfortunately been a very plump,\\nawkward girl, with no more elasticity than a feather-bed. Jessie\\nfound it impossible not to laugh when Fanny ended her display with a\\nsprawl upon the floor, and sat rubbing her elbows in an attitude of\\ndespair.\\n\\n“I know that dance! It is the tzardas, and I can show you how it\\nshould be done. Jump up and try it with me!” she said good-naturedly,\\nrunning to help her friend up, glad to have a partner of her own\\nsize for once.\\n\\nAway they went, but soon stopped; for Fanny could not keep step, and\\nJessie pulled and stamped and hummed in vain.\\n\\n“Do it alone; then I can see how it goes, and manage better next\\ntime,” panted the poor girl, dropping down upon the velvet seat\\nwhich ran round the hall.\\n\\nMademoiselle had come in and watched them for a moment. She saw at\\nonce what was needed, and as Mrs. Fletcher was one of her best\\npatrons, she was glad to oblige the oldest daughter; so she went to\\nthe piano and struck up the proper air just as Jessie, with one arm\\non her hip, the other on the shoulder of an invisible partner, went\\ndown the hall with a martial stamp, a quick slide, and a graceful\\nturn, in perfect time to the stirring music that made her nerves\\ntingle and her feet fly. To and fro, round and round, with all\\nmanner of graceful gestures, intricate steps, and active bounds went\\nthe happy girl, quite carried away by the music and motion of the\\npastime she loved so much.\\n\\nFanny clapped her hands with admiration, and Mademoiselle cried,\\n“Bien, tres bien, charmante, ma cherie!” as she paused at last, rosy\\nand smiling, with one hand on her heart and the other at her temple\\nwith the salute that closed the dance.\\n\\n“I MUST learn it! Do come and give me lessons at our house. I called\\nfor Maud and must go now. Will you come, Jessie? I’ll be glad to pay\\nyou if you don’t mind. I hate to be laughed at; and I know if some\\none would just help me alone I should do as well as the rest, for\\nProfessor Ludwig raves at us all.”\\n\\nFanny seemed in such a sad strait, and Jessie sympathized so\\nheartily with her, that she could not refuse a request which\\nflattered her vanity and tempted her with a prospect of some\\naddition to the “Sister-fund,” as she called her little savings. So\\nshe graciously consented, and after a few laborious lessons\\nprospered so well that her grateful pupil proposed to several other\\nunsuccessful dancers in the set to invite Jessie to the private\\nrehearsals held in various parlors as the festival drew near.\\n\\nSome of these young people knew Jessie Delano, had missed the bright\\ngirl, and gladly welcomed her back when, after much persuasion, she\\nagreed to go and help them with the difficult figures of the\\ntzardas. Once among them she felt in her element, and trained the\\nawkward squad so well that Professor Ludwig complimented them on\\ntheir improvement at the public rehearsals, and raved no more, to\\nthe great delight of the timid damsels, who lost their wits when the\\nfiery little man shouted and wrung his hands over their mistakes.\\n\\nThe young gentlemen needed help also, as several of them looked very\\nmuch like galvanized grasshoppers in their efforts to manage long\\nlegs or awkward elbows. Jessie willingly danced with them, and\\nshowed them how to move with grace and spirit, and handle their\\npartners less like dolls and more like peasant maidens with whom the\\nmartial Hungarians were supposed to be disporting themselves at the\\nfair. Merry meetings were these; and all enjoyed them, as young\\npeople do whatever is lively, dramatic, and social. Every one was\\nfull of the brilliant Kirmess, which was the talk of the city, and\\nto which every one intended to go as actor or spectator. Jessie was\\nsadly tempted to spend three of her cherished dollars for a ticket,\\nand perhaps would have done so if there had been any one to take\\ncare of her. Laura could not go, and Mr. Vane was away; no other\\nfriend appeared, and no one remembered to invite her, so she bravely\\nhid her girlish longing, and got all the pleasure out of the\\nrehearsals that she could.\\n\\nAt the last of these, which was a full-dress affair at Fanny’s\\nhouse, something happened which not only tried Jessie’s temper\\nsorely, but brought her a reward for many small sacrifices. So much\\ndancing was very hard upon her slippers, the new pair were worn out\\nlong ago, and a second pair were in a dangerous condition; but\\nJessie hoped that they would last that evening, and then she would\\nindulge in better ones with what Fanny would pay her. She hated to\\ntake it, but her salary at Mademoiselle’s was needed at home; all\\nshe could spare from other sources was sacredly kept for Laura’s\\njaunt, and only now and then did the good little girl buy some very\\nnecessary article for herself. She was learning to be humble, to\\nlove work, and be grateful for her small wages for her sister’s\\nsake; and while she hid her trials, withstood her temptations, and\\nbravely tugged away at her hard tasks, the kind Providence, who\\nteaches us the sweetness of adversity, was preparing a more\\nbeautiful and helpful surprise than any she could plan or execute.\\n\\nThat night all were much excited, and great was the energy displayed\\nas the scarlet, blue, and silver couples went through the rapid\\nfigures with unusual spirit and success. The brass-heeled boots\\nstamped in perfect time, the furred caps waved, and the braided\\njackets glittered as the gay troop swung to and fro or marched to\\nthe barbaric music of an impromptu band. Jessie looked on with such\\nlonging in her eyes that Fanny, who was ill with a bad cold, kindly\\nbegged her to take her place, as motion made her cough, and putting\\non the red and silver cap sent her joyfully away to lead them all.\\n\\nThe fun grew rather fast and furious toward the end, and when the\\ndance broke up there lay in the middle of the floor a shabby little\\nslipper, burst at the side, trodden down at the heel, and utterly\\ndemoralized as to the bow with a broken buckle in it. Such a\\ndisreputable little shoe was it that no one claimed it when one of\\nthe young men held it up on the point of his sword, exclaiming\\ngayly,--\\n\\n“Where is Cinderella? Here’s her shoe, and it’s quite time she had a\\nnew pair. Glass evidently doesn’t wear well now-a-days.”\\n\\nThey all laughed and looked about to find the shoeless foot. The\\ngirls with small feet displayed them readily; those less blessed hid\\nthem at once, and no Cinderella appeared to claim the old slipper.\\nJessie turned as red as her cap, and glanced imploringly at Fanny as\\nshe slipped through a convenient door and flew up-stairs, knowing\\nthat in a moment all would see that it must be hers, since the other\\ngirls wore red boots as a part of their costume.\\n\\nFanny understood; and though awkward and slow with her feet, she was\\nkind-hearted and quick to spare her friend the mortification which a\\npoor and proud girl could not help feeling at such a moment. The\\nunfortunate slipper was flying from hand to hand as the youths\\nindulged in a boyish game of ball to tease the laughing girls, who\\nhastened to disclaim all knowledge of “the horrid thing.”\\n\\n“Please give it to me!” cried Fanny, trying to catch it, and glad\\nJessie was safe.\\n\\n“No; Cinderella must come and put it on. Here’s the Prince all ready\\nto help her,” said the finder of the shoe, holding it up.\\n\\n“And here are lots of proud sisters ready to cut off their toes and\\nheels if they could only get on such a small slipper,” added another\\nyoung Mygar, enjoying the fun immensely.\\n\\n“Listen, and let me tell you something. It’s Jessie Delano’s, and\\nshe has run away because she lost it. Don’t laugh and make fun of\\nit, because it was worn out in helping us. You all know what a hard\\ntime she has had, but you don’t know how good and brave and patient\\nshe is, trying to help poor Laura and to earn her living. I asked\\nher to teach me, and I shall pay her well for it, because I couldn’t\\nhave gone on if she hadn’t. If any of you feel as grateful as I do,\\nand as sorry for her, you can show it in any kind way you please,\\nfor it must be dreadful to be so poor.”\\n\\nFanny had spoken quickly, and at the last words hid the tremble in\\nher voice with a cough, being rather scared at what she had done on\\nthe impulse of the moment. But it was a true impulse, and the\\ngenerous young hearts were quick to answer it. The old slipper was\\nrespectfully handed to her with many apologies and various penitent\\nsuggestions. None were adopted just then, however, for Fanny ran off\\nto find Jessie with her things on waiting for a chance to slip away\\nunseen. No persuasions would keep her to supper; and at last, with\\nmany thanks, she was allowed to go, while Fanny returned to lay\\nplans with her guests as they disturbed their digestions with\\nlobster salad, ice-cream, and strong coffee.\\n\\nFeeling more than ever like Cinderella as she hurried out into the\\nwinter night, leaving all the good times behind her, Jessie stood\\nwaiting for a car on the windy street-corner, with the ragged\\nslippers under her arm, tears of weariness and vexation in her eyes,\\nand a resentful feeling against an unjust fate lying heavy at her\\nheart. The glimpses of her old gay, easy life, which these\\nrehearsals had given her, made the real hardship and loneliness of\\nher present life all the more irksome, and that night she felt as if\\nshe could not bear it much longer. She longed with all a girl’s love\\nof gayety to go to the Kirmess, and no one thought to invite her.\\nShe could not go alone even if she yielded to temptation and spent\\nher own money. Laura would have to hire a carriage if she ventured\\nto try it; so it was impossible, for six or seven dollars was a\\nfortune to the poor girls now. To have been one of the happy\\ncreatures who were to take part in it, to dance on the green in a\\ndainty costume to the music of a full band,--to see and do and enjoy\\nall the delights of those two enchanting evenings, would have filled\\nJessie’s cup to overflowing. But since she might as well cry for the\\nmoon she tried to get some comfort out of imagining it all as she\\nrumbled home in a snowstorm, and cried herself to sleep after giving\\nLaura a cheerful account of the rehearsal, omitting the catastrophe.\\n\\nThe sun shone next morning, hope woke again, and as she dressed\\nJessie sung to keep her heart up, still trusting that some one would\\nremember her before the day was over. As she opened her windows the\\nsparrows welcomed her with shrill chirpings, and the sun turned the\\nsnow-covered vine to a glittering network very beautiful to see as\\nit hung like a veil of lace over the dingy wall. Jessie smiled as\\nshe saw it, while taking a long breath of the keen air, feeling\\ncheered and refreshed by these familiar comforters; then with a\\nbrave, bright glance up at the clear blue sky she went away to the\\nday’s duties, little guessing what pleasant surprises were on their\\nway to reward her for the little sacrifices which were teaching her\\nstrength, patience, and courage for greater ones by-and-by.\\n\\nAll the morning she listened eagerly for the bell, but nothing came;\\nand at two o’clock she went away to the dancing-class, saying to\\nherself with a sigh,--\\n\\n“Every one is so busy, it is no wonder I’m forgotten. I shall hear\\nabout the fun in the papers, and try to be contented with that.”\\n\\nThough she never felt less like dancing, she was very patient with\\nher little pupils, and when the lesson was over sat resting a\\nmoment, with her head still full of the glories of the Kirmess.\\nSuddenly Mademoiselle came to her, and in a few kind words gave her\\nthe first of the pleasant surprises by offering her a larger salary,\\nan older class, and many commendations for her skill and\\nfaithfulness. Of course she gratefully accepted the welcome offer,\\nand hurried home to tell Laura, forgetting her heavy heart, tired\\nfeet, and disappointed hopes.\\n\\nAt her own door the second surprise stood waiting for her, in the\\nperson of Mrs. Fletcher’s servant with a large box and a note from\\nMiss Fanny. How she ever got herself and her parcel up the long\\nstairs Jessie never knew, she was in such a frantic hurry to see\\nwhat that vast box could contain. She startled her sister by\\nbursting into the room breathless, flushed, and beaming, with the\\nmysterious cry of,--\\n\\n“Scissors! quick, the scissors!”\\n\\nOff went cords and papers, up flew the cover, and with a shriek of\\nrapture Jessie saw the well-known Hungarian costume lying there\\nbefore her. What it all meant she could not guess, till she tore\\nopen the note and read these delightful words:--\\n\\nDEAR JESS,--My cold is worse, and the doctor won’t let me go\\nto-night. Isn’t it dreadful? Our dance will be ruined unless you\\nwill take my place. I know you will to oblige us, and have a lovely\\ntime. Every one will be glad, you do it so much better than I can.\\nMy dress will fit you, with tucks and reefs here and there; and the\\nboots won’t be much too large, for though I’m fat I have small feet,\\nthank goodness! Mamma will call for you at seven, and bring you\\nsafely home; and you must come early to-morrow and tell me all about\\nit.\\n\\nIn the small box you will find a little token of our gratitude to\\nyou for your kindness in helping us all so much. Yours ever,\\n\\nFAN.\\n\\nAs soon as Jessie could get her breath and recover from this first\\ndelightful shock, she opened the dainty parcel carefully tied up\\nwith pink ribbons. It proved to be a crystal slipper, apparently\\nfull of rosebuds; but under the flowers lay five-and-twenty shining\\ngold dollars. A little card with these words was tucked in one\\ncorner, as if, with all their devices to make the offering as\\ndelicate and pretty as possible, the givers feared to offend:--\\n\\n“We return to our dear Princess the glass slipper which she lost at\\nthe ball, full of thanks and good wishes.”\\n\\nIf the kind young persons who sent the fanciful gift could have seen\\nhow it was received, their doubts would soon have been set at rest;\\nfor Jessie laughed and cried as she told the story, counted the\\nprecious coins, and filled the pretty shoe with water that the buds\\nmight keep fresh for Laura. Then, while the needles flew and the gay\\ngarments were fitted, the happy voices talked and the sisters\\nrejoiced together over this unexpected pleasure as only loving girls\\ncould do.\\n\\n“The sweetest part of all the splendid surprise is that they\\nremembered me just at the busiest time, and thanked me in such a\\nlovely way. I shall keep that glass slipper all my life, if I can,\\nto remind me not to despair; for just when everything seemed\\ndarkest, all this good luck came,” said Jessie, with ecstatic skips\\nas she clanked the brass heels of her boots and thought of the proud\\nmoment when she would join in the tzardas before all Boston.\\n\\nGentle Laura rejoiced and sympathized heartily, sewed like a busy\\nbee, and sent her happy sister away at seven o’clock with her\\nsweetest smile, never letting her suspect what tender hopes and\\nfears were hidden in her own heart, what longing and disappointment\\nmade her days doubly sad and lonely, or how very poor a consolation\\nall the glories of the Kirmess would be for the loss of a friend who\\nhad grown very near and dear to her.\\n\\nNo need to tell the raptures of that evening to little Jessie, who\\nenjoyed every moment, played her part well, and was brought home at\\nmidnight ready to begin all over again, so inexhaustible is youth’s\\nappetite for pleasure.\\n\\nTo her great surprise, Laura was up and waiting to welcome her, with\\na face so full of a new and lovely happiness that Jessie guessed at\\nonce some good fortune had come to her also. Yes, Laura’s\\nwell-earned reward and beautiful surprise had arrived at last; and\\nshe told it all in a few words as she held out her arms\\nexclaiming,--\\n\\n“He has come back! He loves me, and I am so happy! Dear little\\nsister, all your hard times are over now, and you shall have a home\\nagain.”\\n\\nSo the dreams came true, as they sometimes do even in this\\nwork-a-day world of ours, when the dreamers strive as well as hope,\\nand earn their rewards.\\n\\nLaura had a restful summer at the seaside, with a stronger arm than\\nJessie’s to lean upon, and more magical medicine to help her back to\\nhealth than any mortal doctor could prescribe. Jessie danced again\\nwith a light heart,--for pleasure, not for pay,--and found the new\\nlife all the sweeter for the trials of the old one. In the autumn\\nthere was a quiet wedding, before three very happy people sailed\\naway to Italy, the artist’s heaven on earth.\\n\\n“No roses for me,” said Jessie, smiling at herself in the mirror as\\nshe fastened a spray of rosy ivy-leaves in the bosom of her fresh\\nwhite gown that October morning. “I’ll be true to my old friend; for\\nit helped me in my dark days, and now it shall rejoice with me in my\\nbright ones, and go on teaching me to climb bravely and patiently\\ntoward the light.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPANSIES\\n\\n\\nThey are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts.--SIR\\nPHILIP SIDNEY.\\n\\n“I’VE finished my book, and now what CAN I do till this tiresome\\nrain is over?” exclaimed Carrie, as she lay back on the couch with a\\nyawn of weariness.\\n\\n“Take another and a better book; the house is full of them, and this\\nis a rare chance for a feast on the best,” answered Alice, looking\\nover the pile of volumes in her lap, as she sat on the floor before\\none of the tall book-cases that lined the room.\\n\\n“Not being a book-worm like you, I can’t read forever, and you\\nneedn’t sniff at ‘Wanda,’ for it’s perfectly thrilling!” cried\\nCarrie, regretfully turning the crumpled leaves of the Seaside\\nLibrary copy of that interminable and impossible tale.\\n\\n“We should read to improve our minds, and that rubbish is only a\\nwaste of time,” began Alice, in a warning tone, as she looked up\\nfrom “Romola,” over which she had been poring with the delight one\\nfeels in meeting an old friend.\\n\\n“I don’t WISH to improve my mind, thank you: I read for amusement in\\nvacation time, and don’t want to see any moral works till next\\nautumn. I get enough of them in school. This isn’t ‘rubbish’! It’s\\nfull of fine descriptions of scenery--”\\n\\n“Which you skip by the page, I’ve seen you do it,” said Eva, the\\nthird young girl in the library, as she shut up the stout book on\\nher knee and began to knit as if this sudden outburst of chat\\ndisturbed her enjoyment of “The Dove in the Eagle’s Nest.”\\n\\n“I do at first, being carried away by my interest in the people, but\\nI almost always go back and read them afterward,” protested Carrie.\\n“You know YOU like to hear about nice clothes, Eva, and Wanda’s were\\nsimply gorgeous; white velvet and a rope of pearls is one costume;\\ngray velvet and a silver girdle another; and Idalia was all a\\n‘shower of perfumed laces,’ and scarlet and gold satin mask dresses,\\nor primrose silk with violets, so lovely! I do revel in ‘em!”\\n\\nBoth girls laughed as Carrie reeled off this list of elegances, with\\nthe relish of a French modiste.\\n\\n“Well, I’m poor and can’t have as many pretty things as I want, so\\nit IS delightful to read about women who wear white quilted satin\\ndressing-gowns and olive velvet trains with Mechlin lace sweepers to\\nthem. Diamonds as large as nuts, and rivers of opals and sapphires,\\nand rubies and pearls, are great fun to read of, if you never even\\nget a look at real ones. I don’t believe the love part does me a bit\\nof harm, for we never see such languid swells in America, nor such\\nlovely, naughty ladies; and Ouida scolds them all, so of course she\\ndoesn’t approve of them, and that’s moral, I’m sure.”\\n\\nBut Alice shook her head again, as Carrie paused out of breath, and\\nsaid in her serious way: “That’s the harm of it all. False and\\nfoolish things are made interesting, and we read for that, not for\\nany lesson there may be hidden under the velvet and jewels and fine\\nwords of your splendid men and women. Now, THIS book is a wonderful\\npicture of Florence in old times, and the famous people who really\\nlived are painted in it, and it has a true and clean moral that we\\ncan all see, and one feels wiser and better for reading it. I do\\nwish you’d leave those trashy things and try something really good.”\\n\\n“I hate George Eliot,--so awfully wise and preachy and dismal! I\\nreally couldn’t wade through ‘Daniel Deronda,’ though ‘The Mill on\\nthe Floss’ wasn’t bad,” answered Carrie, with another yawn, as she\\nrecalled the Jew Mordecai’s long speeches, and Daniel’s meditations.\\n\\n“I know you’d like this,” said Eva, patting her book with an air of\\ncalm content; for she was a modest, common-sense little body, full\\nof innocent fancies and the mildest sort of romance. “I love dear\\nMiss Yonge, with her nice, large families, and their trials, and\\ntheir pious ways, and pleasant homes full of brothers and sisters,\\nand good fathers and mothers. I’m never tired of them, and have read\\n‘Daisy Chain’ nine times at least.”\\n\\n“I used to like them, and still think them good for young girls,\\nwith our own ‘Queechy’ and ‘Wide, Wide World,’ and books of that\\nkind. Now I’m eighteen I prefer stronger novels, and books by great\\nmen and women, because these are always talked about by cultivated\\npeople, and when I go into society next winter I wish to be able to\\nlisten intelligently, and know what to admire.”\\n\\n“That’s all very well for you, Alice; you were always poking over\\nbooks, and I dare say you will write them some day, or be a\\nblue-stocking. But I’ve got another year to study and fuss over my\\neducation, and I’m going to enjoy myself all I can, and leave the\\nwise books till I come out.”\\n\\n“But, Carrie, there won’t be any time to read them; you’ll be so\\nbusy with parties, and beaux, and travelling, and such things. I\\nWOULD take Alice’s advice and read up a little now; it’s so nice to\\nknow useful things, and be able to find help and comfort in good\\nbooks when trouble comes, as Ellen Montgomery and Fleda did, and\\nEthel, and the other girls in Miss Yonge’s stories,” said Eva,\\nearnestly, remembering how much the efforts of those natural little\\nheroines had helped her in her own struggles tor self-control and\\nthe cheerful bearing of the burdens which come to all.\\n\\n“I don’t want to be a priggish Ellen, or a moral Fleda, and I do\\ndetest bothering about self-improvement all the time. I know I\\nought, but I’d rather wait another year or two, and enjoy my\\nvanities in peace just a LITTLE longer.” And Carrie tucked Wanda\\nunder the sofa pillow, as if a trifle ashamed of her society, with\\nEva’s innocent eyes upon her own, and Alice sadly regarding her over\\nthe rampart of wise books, which kept growing higher as the eager\\ngirl found more and more treasures in this richly stored library.\\n\\nA little silence followed, broken only by the patter of the rain\\nwithout, the crackle of the wood fire within, and the scratch of a\\nbusy pen from a curtained recess at the end of the long room. In the\\nsudden hush the girls heard it and remembered that they were not\\nalone.\\n\\n“She must have heard every word we said!” and Carrie sat up with a\\ndismayed face as she spoke in a whisper.\\n\\nEva laughed, but Alice shrugged her shoulders, and said tranquilly,\\n“I don’t mind. She wouldn’t expect much wisdom from school-girls.”\\n\\nThis was cold comfort to Carrie, who was painfully conscious of\\nhaving been a particularly silly school-girl just then. So she gave\\na groan and lay down again, wishing she had not expressed her\\nviews quite so freely, and had kept Wanda for the privacy of her own\\nroom.\\n\\nThe three girls were the guests of a delightful old lady, who had\\nknown their mothers and was fond of renewing her acquaintance with\\nthem through their daughters. She loved young people, and each\\nsummer invited parties of them to enjoy the delights of her\\nbeautiful country house, where she lived alone now, being the\\nchildless widow of a somewhat celebrated man. She made it very\\npleasant for her guests, leaving them free to employ a part of the\\nday as they liked, providing the best of company at dinner, gay\\nrevels in the evening, and a large house full of curious and\\ninteresting things to examine at their leisure.\\n\\nThe rain had spoiled a pleasant plan, and business letters had made\\nit necessary for Mrs. Warburton to leave the three to their own\\ndevices after lunch. They had read quietly for several hours, and\\ntheir hostess was just finishing her last letter when fragments of\\nthe conversation reached her ear. She listened with amusement,\\nunconscious that they had forgotten her presence, finding the\\ndifferent views very characteristic, and easily explained by the\\ndifference of the homes out of which the three friends came.\\n\\nAlice was the only daughter of a scholarly man and a brilliant\\nwoman; therefore her love of books and desire to cultivate her mind\\nwas very natural, but the danger in her case would be in the neglect\\nof other things equally important, too varied reading, and a\\nsuperficial knowledge of many authors rather than a true\\nappreciation of a few of the best and greatest. Eva was one of many\\nchildren in a happy home, with a busy father, a pious mother, and\\nmany domestic cares, as well as joys, already falling to the dutiful\\ngirl’s lot. Her instincts were sweet and unspoiled, and she only\\nneeded to be shown where to find new and better helpers for the real\\ntrials of life, when the childish heroines she loved could no longer\\nserve her in the years to come.\\n\\nCarrie was one of the ambitious yet commonplace girls who wish to\\nshine, without knowing the difference between the glitter of a\\ncandle which attracts moths, and the serene light of a star, or the\\ncheery glow of a fire round which all love to gather. Her mother’s\\naims were not high, and the two pretty daughters knew that she\\ndesired good matches for them, educated them for that end, and\\nexpected them to do their parts when the time came. The elder sister\\nwas now at a watering-place with her mother, and Carrie hoped that a\\nletter would soon come telling her that Mary was settled. During her\\nstay with Mrs. Warburton she had learned a good deal, and was\\nunconsciously contrasting the life here with the frivolous one at\\nhome, made up of public show and private sacrifice of comfort,\\ndignity, and peace. Here were people who dressed simply, enjoyed\\nconversation, kept up their accomplishments even when old, and were\\nso busy, lovable, and charming, that poor Carrie often felt vulgar,\\nignorant, and mortified among them, in spite of their fine breeding\\nand kindliness. The society Mrs. Warburton drew about her was the\\nbest, and old and young, rich and poor, wise and simple, all seemed\\ngenuine,---glad to give or receive, enjoy and rest, and then go out\\nto their work refreshed by the influences of the place and the sweet\\nold lady who made it what it was. The girls would soon begin life\\nfor themselves, and it was well that they had this little glimpse of\\nreally good society before they left the shelter of home to choose\\nfriends, pleasures, and pursuits for themselves, as all young women\\ndo when once launched.\\n\\nThe sudden silence and then the whispers suggested to the listener\\nthat she had perhaps heard something not meant for her ears; so she\\npresently emerged with her letters, and said, as she came smiling\\ntoward the group about the fire,--\\n\\n“How are you getting through this long, dull afternoon, my dears?\\nQuiet as mice till just now. What woke you up? A battle of the\\nbooks? Alice looks as if she had laid in plenty of ammunition, and\\nyou were preparing to besiege her.”\\n\\nThe girls laughed, and all rose, for Madam Warburton was a stately\\nold lady, and people involuntarily treated her with great respect,\\neven in this mannerless age.\\n\\n“We were only talking about books,” began Carrie, deeply grateful\\nthat Wanda was safely out of sight.\\n\\n“And we couldn’t agree,” added Eva, running to ring the bell for the\\nman to take the letters, for she was used to these little offices at\\nhome, and loved to wait on Madam.\\n\\n“Thanks, my love. Now let us talk a little, if you are tired of\\nreading, and if you like to let me share the discussion. Comparing\\ntastes in literature is always a pleasure, and I used to enjoy\\ntalking over books with my girl friends more than anything else.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton sat down in the chair which Alice\\nrolled up, drew Eva to the cushion at her feet, and nodded to the\\nothers as they settled again, with interested faces, one at the\\ntable where the pile of chosen volumes now lay, the other erect upon\\nthe couch where she had been practising the poses “full of languid\\ngrace,” so much affected by her favorite heroines.\\n\\n“Carrie was laughing at me for liking wise books and wanting to\\nimprove my mind. Is it foolish and a waste of time?” asked Alice,\\neager to convince her friend and secure so powerful an ally.\\n\\n“No, my dear, it is a very sensible desire, and I wish more girls\\nhad it. Only don’t be greedy, and read too much; cramming and\\nsmattering is as bad as promiscuous novel-reading, or no reading at\\nall. Choose carefully, read intelligently, and digest thoroughly\\neach book, and then you make it your own,” answered Mrs. Warburton,\\nquite in her element now, for she loved to give advice, as most old\\nladies do.\\n\\n“But how can we know WHAT to read if we mayn’t follow our tastes?”\\n said Carrie, trying to be interested and “intelligent” in spite of\\nher fear that a “school-marmy” lecture was in store for her.\\n\\n“Ask advice, and so cultivate a true and refined taste. I always\\njudge people’s characters a good deal by the books they like, as\\nwell as by the company they keep; so one should be careful, for this\\nis a pretty good test. Another is, be sure that whatever will not\\nbear reading aloud is not fit to read to one’s self. Many young\\ngirls ignorantly or curiously take up books quite worthless, and\\nreally harmful, because under the fine writing and brilliant color\\nlurks immorality or the false sentiment which gives wrong ideas of\\nlife and things which should be sacred. They think, perhaps, that no\\none knows this taste of theirs; but they are mistaken, for it shows\\nitself in many ways, and betrays them. Attitudes, looks, careless\\nwords, and a morbid or foolishly romantic view of certain things,\\nshow plainly that the maidenly instincts are blunted, and harm done\\nthat perhaps can never be repaired.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton kept her eyes fixed upon the tall andirons as if\\ngravely reproving them, which was a great relief to Carrie, whose\\ncheeks glowed as she stirred uneasily and took up a screen as if to\\nguard them from the fire. But conscience pricked her sharply, and\\nmemory, like a traitor, recalled many a passage or scene in her\\nfavorite books which she could not have read aloud even to that old\\nlady, though she enjoyed them in private. Nothing very bad, but\\nfalse and foolish, poor food for a lively fancy and young mind to\\nfeed on, as the weariness or excitement which always followed\\nplainly proved, since one should feel refreshed, not cloyed, with an\\nintellectual feast.\\n\\nAlice, with both elbows on the table, listened with wide-awake eyes,\\nand Eva watched the raindrops trickle clown the pane with an intent\\nexpression, as if asking herself if she had ever done this naughty\\nthing.\\n\\n“Then there is another fault,” continued Mrs. Warburton, well\\nknowing that her first shot had hit its mark, and anxious to be\\njust. “Some book-loving lassies have a mania for trying to read\\neverything, and dip into works far beyond their powers, or try too\\nmany different kinds of self-improvement at once. So they get a\\nmuddle of useless things into their heads, instead of well-assorted\\nideas and real knowledge. They must learn to wait and select; for\\neach age has its proper class of books, and what is Greek to us at\\neighteen may be just what we need at thirty. One can get mental\\ndyspepsia on meat and wine as well as on ice-cream and frosted cake,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice smiled, and pushed away four of the eight books she had\\nselected, as if afraid she had been greedy, and now felt that it was\\nbest to wait a little.\\n\\nEva looked up with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, “Now\\nit is my turn. Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to\\nRuskin, Kant, or Plato?”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton laughed, as she stroked the pretty brown head at her\\nknee.\\n\\n“Not yet, my love, perhaps never, for those are not the masters you\\nneed, I fancy. Since you like stories about every-day people, try\\nsome of the fine biographies of real men and women about whom you\\nshould know something. You will find their lives full of stirring,\\nhelpful, and lovely experiences, and in reading of these you will\\nget courage and hope and faith to bear your own trials as they come.\\nTrue stories suit you, and are the best, for there we get real\\ntragedy and comedy, and the lessons all must learn.”\\n\\n“Thank you! I will begin at once if you will kindly give me a list\\nof such as would be good for me,” cried Eva, with the sweet docility\\nof one eager to be all that is lovable and wise in woman.\\n\\n“Give us a list, and we will try to improve in the best way. You\\nknow what we need, and love to help foolish girls, or you wouldn’t\\nbe so kind and patient with us,” said Alice, going to sit beside\\nCarrie, hoping for much discussion of this, to her, very interesting\\nsubject.\\n\\n“I will, with pleasure; but I read few modern novels, so I may not\\nbe a good judge there. Most of them seem very poor stuff, and I\\ncannot waste time even to skim them as some people do. I still like\\nthe old-fashioned ones I read as a girl, though you would laugh at\\nthem. Did any of you ever read ‘Thaddeus of Warsaw’?”\\n\\n“I have, and thought it very funny; so were ‘Evelina’ and ‘Cecilia.’\\nI wanted to try Smollett and Fielding, after reading some fine\\nessays about them, but Papa told me I must wait,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Ah, my dears, in my day, Thaddeus was our hero, and we thought the\\nscene where he and Miss Beaufort are in the Park a most thrilling\\none. Two fops ask Thaddeus where he got his boots, and he replies,\\nwith withering dignity, ‘Where I got my sword, gentlemen.’ I\\ntreasured the picture of that episode for a long time. Thaddeus\\nwears a hat as full of black plumes as a hearse, Hessian boots with\\ntassels, and leans over Mary, who languishes on the seat in a\\nshort-waisted gown, limp scarf, poke bonnet, and large bag,--the height\\nof elegance then, but very funny now. Then William Wallace in ‘Scottish\\nChiefs.’ Bless me! we cried over him as much as you do over your ‘Heir\\nof Clifton,’ or whatever the boy’s name is. You wouldn’t get through it,\\nI fancy; and as for poor, dear, prosy Richardson, his letter-writing\\nheroines would bore you to death. Just imagine a lover saying to a\\nfriend, ‘I begged my angel to stay and sip one dish of tea. She sipped\\none dish and flew.’”\\n\\n“Now, I’m sure that’s sillier than anything the Duchess ever wrote\\nwith her five-o’clock teas and flirtations over plum-cake on lawns,”\\n cried Carrie, as they all laughed at the immortal Lovelace.\\n\\n“I never read Richardson, but he couldn’t be duller than Henry\\nJames, with his everlasting stories, full of people who talk a great\\ndeal and amount to nothing. _I_ like the older novels best, and\\nenjoy some of Scott’s and Miss Edgeworth’s better than Howells’s, or\\nany of the modern realistic writers, with their elevators, and\\npaint-pots, and every-day people,” said Alice, who wasted little\\ntime on light literature.\\n\\n“I’m glad to hear you say so, for I have an old-fashioned fancy that\\nI’d rather read about people as they were, for that is history, or\\nas they might and should be, for that helps us in our own efforts;\\nnot as they are, for that we know, and are all sufficiently\\ncommonplace ourselves, to be the better for a nobler and wider view\\nof life and men than any we are apt to get, so busy are we earning\\ndaily bread, or running after fortune, honor or some other bubble.\\nBut I mustn’t lecture, or I shall bore you, and forget that I am\\nyour hostess, whose duty it is to amuse.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton paused, Carrie, anxious to change the subject,\\nsaid, with her eyes on a curious jewel which the old lady wore, “I\\nalso like true stories, and you promised to tell us about that\\nlovely pin some day. This is just the time for it,--please do.”\\n\\n“With pleasure, for the little romance is quite apropos to our\\npresent chat. It is a very simple tale, and rather sad, but it had a\\ngreat influence on my life, and this brooch is very dear to me.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton sat silent a moment, the girls all looked with\\ninterest at the quaint pin which clasped the soft folds of muslin\\nover the black silk dress which was as becoming to the still\\nhandsome woman as the cap on her white hair and the winter roses in\\nher cheeks. The ornament was in the shape of a pansy; its purple\\nleaves were of amethyst, the yellow of topaz, and in the middle lay\\na diamond drop of dew. Several letters were delicately cut on its\\ngolden stem, and a guard pin showed how much its wearer valued it.\\n\\n“My sister Lucretia was a good deal older than I, for the three boys\\ncame between,” began Mrs. Warburton, still gazing at the fire, as if\\nfrom its ashes the past rose up bright and warm again. “She was a\\nvery lovely and superior girl, and I looked up to her with wonder as\\nwell as adoration. Others did the same, and at eighteen she was\\nengaged to a charming man, who would have made his mark had he\\nlived. She was too young to marry then, and Frank Lyman had a fine\\nopening to practise his profession at the South. So they parted for\\ntwo years, and it was then that he gave her the brooch, saying to\\nher, as she whispered how lonely she should be without him, ‘This\\nPENSEE is a happy, faithful THOUGHT of me. Wear it, dearest girl,\\nand don’t pine while we are separated. Read and study, write much to\\nme, and remember, “They never are alone that are accompanied with\\nnoble thoughts.”’”\\n\\n“Wasn’t that sweet?” cried Eva, pleased with the beginning of the\\ntale.\\n\\n“So romantic!” added Carrie, recalling the “amber amulet” one of her\\npet heroes wore for years, and died kissing, after he had killed\\nsome fifty Arabs in the desert.\\n\\n“Did she read and study?” asked Alice, with a soft color in her\\ncheek, and eager eyes, for a budding romance was folded away in the\\ndepths of her maidenly heart, and she liked a love story.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what she did, for it was rather remarkable at that\\nday, when girls had little schooling, and picked up accomplishments\\nas they could. The first winter she read and studied at home, and\\nwrote much to Mr. Lyman. I have their letters now, and very fine\\nones they are, though they would seem old-fashioned to you young\\nthings. Curious love letters,--full of advice, the discussion of\\nbooks, report of progress, glad praise, modest gratitude, happy\\nplans and a faithful affection that never wavered, though Lucretia\\nwas beautiful and much admired, and the dear fellow a great favorite\\namong the brilliant Southern women.\\n\\n“The second spring, Lucretia, anxious to waste no time, and\\nambitious to surprise Lyman, decided to go and study with old Dr.\\nGardener at Portland. He fitted young men for college, was a friend\\nof our father’s, and had a daughter who was a very wise and\\naccomplished woman. That was a very happy summer, and Lu got on so\\nwell that she begged to stay all winter. It was a rare chance, for\\nthere were no colleges for girls then, and very few advantages to be\\nhad, and the dear creature burned to improve every faculty, that she\\nmight be more worthy of her lover. She fitted herself for college\\nwith the youths there, and did wonders; for love sharpened her wits,\\nand the thought of that happy meeting spurred her on to untiring\\nexertion. Lyman was expected in May, and the wedding was to be in\\nJune; but, alas for the poor girl! the yellow-fever came, and he was\\none of the first victims. They never met again, and nothing was left\\nher of all that happy time but his letters, his library, and the\\npansy.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton paused to wipe a few quiet tears from her eyes, while\\nthe girls sat in sympathetic silence.\\n\\n“We thought it would kill her, that sudden change from love, hope,\\nand happiness to sorrow, death, and solitude. But hearts don’t\\nbreak, my dears, if they know where to go for strength. Lucretia\\ndid, and after the first shock was over found comfort in her books,\\nsaying, with a brave, bright look, and the sweetest resignation, ‘I\\nmust go on trying to be more worthy of him, for we shall meet again\\nin God’s good time and he shall see that I do not forget.’\\n\\n“That was better than tears and lamentation, and the long years that\\nfollowed were beautiful and busy ones, full of dutiful care for us\\nat home after our mother died, of interest in all the good works of\\nher time, and a steady, quiet effort to improve every faculty of her\\nfine mind, till she was felt to be one of the noblest women in our\\ncity. Her influence was wide-spread; all the intelligent people\\nsought her, and when she travelled she was welcome everywhere, for\\ncultivated persons have a free-masonry of their own, and are\\nrecognized at once.”\\n\\n“Did she ever marry?” asked Carrie, feeling that no life could be\\nquite successful without that great event.\\n\\n“Never. She felt herself a widow, and wore black to the day of her\\ndeath. Many men asked her hand, but she refused them all, and was\\nthe sweetest ‘old maid’ ever seen,--cheerful and serene to the very\\nlast, for she was ill a long time, and found her solace and stay\\nstill in the beloved books. Even when she could no longer read them,\\nher memory supplied her with the mental food that kept her soul\\nstrong while her body failed. It was wonderful to see and hear her\\nrepeating fine lines, heroic sayings, and comforting psalms through\\nthe weary nights when no sleep would come, making friends and\\nhelpers of the poets, philosophers, and saints whom she knew and\\nloved so well. It made death beautiful, and taught me how victorious\\nan immortal soul can be over the ills that vex our mortal flesh.\\n\\n“She died at dawn on Easter Sunday, after a quiet night, when she\\nhad given me her little legacy of letters, books, and the one jewel\\nshe had always worn, repeating her lover’s words to comfort me. I\\nhad read the Commendatory Prayer, and as I finished she whispered,\\nwith a look of perfect peace, ‘Shut the book, dear, I need study no\\nmore; I have hoped and believed, now I shall know;’ and so went\\nhappily away to meet her lover after patient waiting.”\\n\\nThe sigh of the wind was the only sound that broke the silence till\\nthe quiet voice went on again, as if it loved to tell the story, for\\nthe thought of soon seeing the beloved sister took the sadness from\\nthe memory of the past.\\n\\n“I also found my solace in books, for I was very lonely when she was\\ngone, my father being dead, the brothers married, and home desolate.\\nI took to study and reading as a congenial employment, feeling no\\ninclination to marry, and for many years was quite contented among\\nmy books. But in trying to follow in dear Lucretia’s footsteps, I\\nunconsciously fitted myself for the great honor and happiness of my\\nlife, and curiously enough I owed it to a book.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton smiled as she took up a shabby little volume from the\\ntable where Alice had laid it, and, quick to divine another romance,\\nEva said, like a story-loving child, “Do tell about it! The other\\nwas so sad.”\\n\\n“This begins merrily, and has a wedding in it, as young girls think\\nall tales should. Well, when I was about thirty-five, I was invited\\nto join a party of friends on a trip to Canada, that being the\\nfavorite jaunt in my young days. I’d been studying hard for some\\nyears, and needed rest, so I was glad to go. As a good book for an\\nexcursion, I took this Wordsworth in my bag. It is full of fine\\npassages, you know, and I loved it, for it was one of the books\\ngiven to Lucretia by her lover. We had a charming time, and were on\\nour way to Quebec when my little adventure happened. I was in\\nraptures over the grand St. Lawrence as we steamed slowly from\\nMontreal that lovely summer day. I could not read, but sat on the\\nupper deck, feasting my eyes and dreaming dreams as even staid\\nmaiden ladies will when out on a holiday. Suddenly I caught the\\nsound of voices in earnest discussion on the lower deck, and,\\nglancing down, saw several gentlemen leaning against the rail as\\nthey talked over certain events of great public interest at that\\nmoment. I knew that a party of distinguished persons were on\\nboard, as my friend’s husband, Dr. Tracy, knew some of them, and\\npointed out Mr. Warburton as one of the rising scientific men of the\\nday. I remembered that my sister had met him years ago, and much\\nadmired him both for his own gifts and because he had known Lyman.\\nAs other people were listening, I felt no delicacy about doing the\\nsame, for the conversation was an eloquent one, and well worth\\ncatching. So interested did I become that I forgot the great rafts\\nfloating by, the picturesque shores, the splendid river, and leaned\\nnearer and nearer that no word might be lost, till my book slid out\\nof my lap and fell straight down upon the head of one of the\\ngentlemen, giving him a smart blow, and knocking his hat overboard.”\\n\\n“Oh, what DID you do?” cried the girls, much amused at this\\nunromantic catastrophe.\\n\\nMrs. Warburton clasped her hands dramatically, as her eyes twinkled\\nand a pretty color came into her cheeks at the memory of that\\nexciting moment.\\n\\n“My dears, I could have dropped with mortification! What COULD I do\\nbut dodge and peep as I waited to see the end of this most untoward\\naccident? Fortunately I was alone on that side of the deck, so none\\nof the ladies saw my mishap and, slipping along the seat to a\\ndistant corner, I hid my face behind a convenient newspaper, as I\\nwatched the little flurry of fishing up the hat by a man in a boat\\nnear by, and the merriment of the gentlemen over this assault of\\nWilliam Wordsworth upon Samuel Warburton. The poor book passed from\\nhand to hand, and many jokes were made upon the ‘fair Helen’ whose\\nname was written on the paper cover which projected it.\\n\\n“‘I knew a Miss Harper once,--a lovely woman, but her name was not\\nHelen, and she is dead,--God bless her!’ I heard Mr. Warburton say,\\nas he flapped his straw hat to dry it, and rubbed his head, which\\nfortunately was well covered with thick gray hair at that time.\\n\\n“I longed to go down and tell him who I was, but I had not the\\ncourage to face all those men. It really was MOST embarrassing; so I\\nwaited for a more private moment to claim my book, as I knew we\\nshould not land till night, so there was no danger of losing it.\\n\\n“‘This is rather unusual stuff for a woman to be reading. Some\\nliterary lady doubtless. Better look her up, Warburton. You’ll know\\nher by the color of her stockings when she comes down to lunch,’\\nsaid a jolly old gentlenoan, in a tone that made me ‘rouge high,’ as\\nEvelina says.\\n\\n“‘I shall know her by her intelligent face and conversation, if this\\nbook belongs to a lady. It will be an honor and a pleasure to meet a\\nwoman who enjoys Wordsworth, for in my opinion he is one of our\\ntruest poets,’ answered Mr. Warburton, putting the book in his\\npocket, with a look and a tone that were most respectful and\\ncomforting to me just then.\\n\\n“I hoped he would examine the volume, for Lucretia’s and Lyman’s\\nnames were on the fly leaf, and that would be a delightful\\nintroduction for me. So I said nothing and bided my time, feeling\\nrather foolish when we all filed in to lunch, and I saw the other\\nparty glancing at the ladies at the table. Mr. Warburton’s eye\\npaused a moment as it passed from Mrs. Tracy to me, and I fear I\\nblushed like a girl, my dears, for Samuel had very fine eyes, and I\\nremembered the stout gentleman’s unseemly joke about the stockings.\\nMine were white as snow, for I had a neat foot, and was fond of nice\\nhose and well-made shoes. I am so still, as you see.” Here the old\\nlady displayed a small foot in a black silk stocking and delicate\\nslipper, with the artless pride a woman feels, at any age, in one of\\nher best points. The girls gratified her by a murmur of admiration,\\nand, decorously readjusting the folds of her gown, she went on with\\nthe most romantic episode of her quiet life.\\n\\n“I retired to my state-room after lunch to compose myself, and when\\nI emerged, in the cool of the afternoon, my first glance showed me\\nthat the hour had come, for there on deck was Mr. Warburton, talking\\nto Mrs. Tracy, with my book in his hand. I hesitated a moment, for\\nin spite of my age I was rather shy, and really it was not an easy\\nthing to apologize to a strange gentle-man for dropping books on\\nhis head and spoiling his hat. Men think so much of their hats you\\nknow. I was spared embarrassment, however, for he saw me and came to\\nme at once, saying, in the most cordial manner, as he showed the\\nnames on the fly leaf of my Wordsworth, ‘I am sure we need no other\\nintroduction but the names of these two dear friends of ours. I am\\nvery glad to find that Miss Helen Harper is the little girl I saw\\nonce or twice at your father’s house some years ago, and to meet her\\nso pleasantly again.’\\n\\n“That made everything easy and delightful, and when I had apologized\\nand been laughingly assured that he considered it rather an honor\\nthan otherwise to be assaulted by so great a man, we fell to talking\\nof old times, and soon forgot that we were strangers. He was twenty\\nyears older than I, but a handsome man, and a most interesting and\\nexcellent one, as we all know. He had lost a young wife long ago,\\nand had lived for science ever since, but it had not made him dry,\\nor cold, or selfish. He was very young at heart for all his wisdom,\\nand enjoyed that holiday like a boy out of school. So did I, and\\nnever dreamed that anything would come of it but a pleasant\\nfriendship founded on our love for those now dead and gone. Dear me!\\nhow strangely things turn out in this world of ours, and how the\\ndropping of that book changed my life! Well, that was our\\nintroduction, and that first long conversation was followed by many\\nmore equally charming, during the three weeks our parties were much\\ntogether, as both were taking the same trip, and Dr. Tracy was glad\\nto meet his old friend.\\n\\n“I need not tell you how delightful such society was to me, nor how\\nsurprised I was when, on the last day before we parted, Mr.\\nWarburton, who had answered many questions of mine during these long\\nchats of ours, asked me a very serious one, and I found that I could\\nanswer it as he wished. It brought me great honor as well as\\nhappiness. I fear I was not worthy of it, but I tried to be, and\\nfelt a tender satisfaction in thinking that I owed it to dear\\nLucretia, in part at least; for my effort to imitate her made me\\nfitter to become a wise man’s wife, and thirty years of very sweet\\ncompanionship was my reward.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton bowed her head before the portrait of a\\nvenerable old man which hung above the mantel-piece.\\n\\nIt was a pretty, old-fashioned expression of wifely pride and\\nwomanly tenderness in the fine old lady, who forgot her own gifts,\\nand felt only humility and gratitude to the man who had found in her\\na comrade in intellectual pursuits, as well as a helpmeet at home\\nand a gentle prop for his declining years.\\n\\nThe girls looked up with eyes full of something softer than mere\\ncuriosity, and felt in their young hearts how precious and honorable\\nsuch a memory must be, how true and beautiful such a marriage was,\\nand how sweet wisdom might become when it went hand in hand with\\nlove.\\n\\nAlice spoke first, saying, as she touched the worn cover of the\\nlittle book with a new sort of respect, “Thank you very much!\\nPerhaps I ought not to have taken this from the corner shelves in\\nyour sanctum? I wanted to find the rest of the lines Mr. Thornton\\nquoted last night, and didn’t stop to ask leave.”\\n\\n“You are welcome, my love, for you know how to treat books. Yes,\\nthose in that little case are my precious relics. I keep them all,\\nfrom my childish hymn-book to my great-grandfather’s brass-bound\\nBible, for by and by when I sit ‘Looking towards Sunset,’ as dear\\nLydia Maria Child calls our last days, I shall lose my interest in\\nother books, and take comfort in these. At the end as at the\\nbeginning of life we are all children again, and love the songs our\\nmothers sung us, and find the one true Book our best teacher as we\\ndraw near to God.”\\n\\nAs the reverent voice paused, a ray of sunshine broke through the\\nparting clouds, and shone full on the serene old face turned to meet\\nit, with a smile that welcomed the herald of a lovely sunset.\\n\\n“The rain is over; there will be just time for a run in the garden\\nbefore dinner, girls. I must go and change my cap, for literary\\nladies should not neglect to look well after the ways of their\\nhousehold and keep themseves tidy, no matter how old they may be.”\\n And with a nod Mrs. Warburton left them, wondering what the effect\\nof the conversation would be on the minds of her young guests.\\n\\nAlice went away to the garden, thinking of Lucretia and her lover,\\nas she gathered flowers in the sunshine. Conscientious Eva took the\\nLife of Mary Somerville to her room, and read diligently for half an\\nhour, that no time might be lost in her new course of study, Carrie\\nsent Wanda and her finery up the chimney in a lively blaze, and, as\\nshe watched the book burn, decided to take her blue and gold volume\\nof Tennyson with her on her next trip to Nahant, in case any\\neligible learned or literary man’s head should offer itself as a\\nshining mark. Since a good marriage was the end of life, why not\\nfollow Mrs. Warburton’s example, and make a really excellent one?\\n\\nWhen they all met at dinner-time the old lady was pleased to see a\\nnosegay of fresh pansies in the bosoms of her three youngest guests,\\nand to hear Alice whisper, with grateful eyes,--\\n\\n“We wear your flower to show you that we don’t mean to forget the\\nlesson you so kindly gave us, and to fortify ourselves with ‘noble\\nthoughts,’ as you and she did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWATER-LILIES\\n\\n\\nA PARTY of people, young and old, sat on the piazza of a seaside\\nhotel one summer morning, discussing plans for the day as they\\nwaited for the mail.\\n\\n“Hullo! here comes Christie Johnstone,” exclaimed one of the young\\nmen perched on the railing, who was poisoning the fresh air with the\\nsickly scent of a cigarette.\\n\\n“So ‘tis, with ‘Flucker, the baddish boy,’ in tow, as large as\\nlife,” added another, with a pleasant laugh as he turned to look.\\n\\nThe new-comers certainly looked somewhat like Charles Reade’s\\npicturesque pair, and every one watched them with idle interest as\\nthey drew nearer. A tall, robust girl of seventeen, with dark eyes\\nand hair, a fine color on her brown cheek, and vigor in every\\nmovement, came up the rocky path from the beach with a basket of\\nlobsters on one arm, of fish on the other, and a wicker tray of\\nwater-lilies on her head. The scarlet and silver of the fish\\ncontrasted prettily with the dark blue of her rough dress, and the\\npile of water flowers made a fitting crown for this bonny young\\nfish-wife. A sturdy lad of twelve came lurching after her in a pair\\nof very large rubber boots, with a dilapidated straw hat on the back\\nof his head and a pail on either arm.\\n\\nStraight on went the girl, never turning head or eyes as she passed\\nthe group on the piazza and vanished round the corner, though it was\\nevident that she heard the laugh the last speech produced, for the\\ncolor deepened in her cheeks and her step quickened. The boy,\\nhowever, returned the glances bent upon him, and answered the smiles\\nwith such a cheerful grin that the youth with the cigarette called\\nout,--\\n\\n“Good-morning, Skipper! Where do you hail from?”\\n\\n“Island, yender,” answered the boy, with a gesture of his thumb over\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\n“Oh, you are the lighthouse-keeper, are you?”\\n\\n“No, I ain’t; me and Gramper’s fishermen now.”\\n\\n“Your name is Flucker Johnstone, and your sister’s Christie, I\\nthink?” added the youth, enjoying the amusement of the young ladies\\nabout him.\\n\\n“It’s Sammy Bowen, and hern’s Ruth.”\\n\\n“Have you got a Boaz over there for her?”\\n\\n“No, we’ve got a devil-fish, a real whacker.”\\n\\nThis unexpected reply produced a roar from the gentlemen, while the\\nboy grinned good-naturedly, though without the least idea what the\\njoke was. Pretty Miss Ellery, who had been told that she had “a\\nrippling laugh,” rippled sweetly as she leaned over the railing to\\nask,\\n\\n“Are those lilies in your pails? I want some if they are for sale.”\\n\\n“Sister’ll fetch ‘em round when she’s left the lobs. I ain’t got\\nnone; this is bait for them fellers.” And, as if reminded of\\nbusiness by the yells of several boys who had just caught sight of\\nhim, Sammy abruptly weighed anchor and ran before the wind toward\\nthe stable.\\n\\n“Funny lot, these natives! Act as if they owned the place and are as\\nstupid as their own fish,” said the youth in the white yachting\\nsuit, as he flung away his cigarette end.\\n\\n“Don’t agree with you, Fred. I’ve known people of this sort all my\\nlife and a finer set of honest, hardworking, independent men I never\\nmet,--brave as lions and tender as women in spite of their rough\\nways,” answered the other young man, who wore blue flannel and had a\\ngold band on his cap.\\n\\n“Sailors and soldiers always stand by one another; so of course you\\nsee the best side of these fellows, Captain. The girls are fine\\ncreatures, I grant you; but their good looks don’t last long, more’s\\nthe pity!”\\n\\n“Few women’s would with the life they lead, so full of hard work,\\nsuspense, and sorrow. No one knows till one is tried, how much\\ncourage and faith it takes to keep young and happy when the men one\\nloves are on the great sea,” said a quiet, gray-haired lady, as she\\nlaid her hand on the knee of the young man in blue with a look that\\nmade him smile affectionately at her, with his own brown hand on\\nhers.\\n\\n“Shouldn’t wonder if Ben Bowen was laid up, since the girl brings\\nthe fish. He’s a fine old fellow. I’ve been to No Man’s Land many a\\ntime blue-fishing with him; must ask after him,” said an elderly\\ngentleman who was pacing to and fro yearning for the morning papers.\\n\\n“We might go over to the island and have a chowder-party or a\\nfish-fry some moonlight night. I haven’t been here for several\\nyears, but it used to be great fun, and I suppose we can do it now,”\\n suggested Miss Ellery with the laugh.\\n\\n“By Jove, we will! And look up Christie; ask her when she comes\\nround,” said Mr. Fred, the youthful dude, untwining his languid legs\\nas if the prospect put a little life into him.\\n\\n“Of course we pay for any trouble we give; these people will do\\nanything for money,” began Miss Ellery; but Captain John, as they\\ncalled the sailor, held up his hand with a warning, “Hush! she’s\\ncoming,” as Ruth’s weather-beaten brown hat turned the corner.\\n\\nShe paused a moment to drop the empty baskets, shake her skirts, and\\nput up a black braid that had fallen down; then, with the air of one\\nresolved to do a distasteful task as quickly as possible, she came\\nup the steps, held out the rough basket cover, and said in a clear\\nvoice,--\\n\\n“Would any of the ladies like some fresh lilies? Ten cents a bunch.”\\n\\nA murmur from the ladies expressed their admiration of the beautiful\\nflowers, and the gentlemen pressed forward to buy and present every\\nbunch with gallant haste. Ruth’s eyes shone as the money fell into\\nher hand, and several voices begged her to bring more lilies while\\nthey lasted.\\n\\n“I didn’t know the darlings would grow in salt water,” said Miss\\nEllery, as she fondly gazed upon the cluster Mr. Fred had just\\noffered her.\\n\\n“They don’t. There’s a little fresh-water pond on our island, and\\nthey grow there,--only place for miles round;” and Ruth looked at\\nthe delicate girl in ruffled white lawn and a mull hat, with a\\nglance of mingled pity for her ignorance and admiration for her\\nbeauty.\\n\\n“How silly of me! I am SUCH a goose;” and Miss Ellery gurgled as she\\nhid her face behind her red parasol.\\n\\n“Ask about the fish-fry,” whispered Mr. Fred, putting his head\\nbehind the rosy screen to assure the pretty creature that he didn’t\\nknow any better himself.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I will!” and, quite consoled, Miss Ellery called out,\\n“Girl, will you tell me if we can have chowder-parties on your rocks\\nas we used to a few seasons ago?”\\n\\n“If you bring your own fish. Grandpa is sick and can’t get ‘em for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“We will provide them, but who will cook them for us? It’s such\\nhorrid work.”\\n\\n“Any one can fry fish! I will if you want me to;” and Ruth half\\nsmiled, remembering that this girl who shuddered at the idea of pork\\nand a hot frying-pan, used to eat as heartily as any one when the\\ncrisp brown cunners were served up.\\n\\n“Very good; then we’ll engage you as cook, and come over to-night if\\nit’s clear and our fishing prospers. Don’t forget a dozen of the\\nfinest lilies for this lady to-morrow morning. Pay you now, may not\\nbe up;” and Mr. Fred dropped a bright silver dollar into the basket\\nwith a patronizing air, intended to impress this rather too\\nindependent young person with a proper sense of inferiority.\\n\\nRuth quietly shook the money out upon the door-mat, and said with a\\nsudden sparkle in her black eyes,--\\n\\n“It’s doubtful if I bring any more. Better wait till I do.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry your grandfather is sick. I’ll come over and see him\\nby-and-by, and bring the papers if he would like some,” said the\\nelderly gentleman as he came up with a friendly nod and real\\ninterest in his face.\\n\\n“Very much, thank you, sir. He is very feeble now;” and Ruth turned\\nwith a bright smile to welcome kind Mr. Wallace, who had not\\nforgotten the old man.\\n\\n“Christie has got a nice little temper of her own, and don’t know\\nhow to treat a fellow when he wants to do her a favor,” growled Mr.\\nFred, pocketing his dollar with a disgusted air.\\n\\n“She appears to know how to treat a gentleman when HE offers one,”\\n answered Blue Jacket, with a twinkle of the eye as if he enjoyed the\\nother’s discomfiture.\\n\\n“Girls of that class always put on airs if they are the least bit\\npretty,--so absurd!” said Miss Ellery, pulling up her long gloves as\\nshe glanced at the brown arms of the fisher maiden.\\n\\n“Girls of any class like to be treated with respect. Modesty in\\nlinsey-woolsey is as sweet as in muslin, my dear, and should be even\\nmore admired, according to my old-fashioned way of thinking,” said\\nthe gray-haired lady.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” murmured her sailor nephew with an approving nod.\\n\\nIt was evident that Ruth had heard also, as she turned to go, for\\nwith a quick gesture she pulled three great lilies from her hat and\\nlaid them on the old lady’s lap, saying with a grateful look, “Thank\\nyou, ma’am.”\\n\\nShe had seen Miss Scott hand her bunch to a meek little governess\\nwho had been forgotten, and this was all she had to offer in return\\nfor the kindness which is so sweet to poor girls whose sensitive\\npride gets often wounded by trifles like these.\\n\\nShe was going without her baskets when Captain John swung himself\\nover the railing, and ran after her with them. He touched his cap as\\nhe met her, and was thanked with as bright a smile as that the elder\\ngentleman had received; for his respectful “Miss Bowen” pleased her\\nmuch after the rude “Girl!” and the money tossed to her as if she\\nwere a beggar. When he came back the mail had arrived, and all\\nscattered at once,--Mr. Fred to spend the dollar in more cigarettes,\\nand Captain John to settle carefully in his button-hole the\\nwater-lily Aunt Mary gave him, before both young men went off to\\nplay tennis as if their bread depended on it.\\n\\nAs it bid fair to be a moonlight night, the party of a dozen young\\npeople, with Miss Scott and Mr. Wallace to act as matron and admiral\\nof the fleet, set off to the Island about sunset. Fish in abundance\\nhad been caught, and a picnic supper provided to be eaten on the\\nrocks when the proper time arrived. They found Sammy, in a clean\\nblue shirt and a hat less like a Feejee headpiece, willing to do the\\nhonors of the Island, beaming like a freckled young merman as he\\npaddled out to pull up the boats.\\n\\n“Fire’s all ready for kindlin’, and Ruth’s slicin’ the pertaters.\\nHope them fish is cleaned?” he added with a face of deep anxiety;\\nfor that weary task would fall to him if not already done, and the\\nthought desolated his boyish soul.\\n\\n“All ready, Sam! Lend a hand with these baskets, and then steer for\\nthe lighthouse; the ladies want to see that first,” answered Captain\\nJohn, as he tossed a stray cookie into Sammy’s mouth with a smile\\nthat caused that youth to cleave to him like a burr all the evening.\\n\\nThe young people scattered over the rocks, and hastened to visit the\\npoints of interest before dark. They climbed the lighthouse tower,\\nand paid Aunt Nabby and Grandpa a call at the weather-beaten little\\nhouse, where the old woman lent them a mammoth coffee-pot, and\\npromised that Ruth would “dish up them fish in good shape at eight\\npunctooal.” Then they strolled away to see the fresh-water pond\\nwhere the lilies grew.\\n\\n“How curious that such a thing should be here right in the middle of\\nthe salt sea!” said one of the girls, as they stood looking at the\\nquiet pool while the tide dashed high upon the rocks all about them.\\n\\n“Not more curious than how it is possible for anything so beautiful\\nand pure as one of those lilies to grow from the mud at the bottom\\nof the pond. The ugly yellow ones are not so out of place; but no\\none cares for them, and they smell horridly,” added another girl in\\na reflective tone.\\n\\n“Instinct sends the white lily straight up to the sun and air, and\\nthe strong slender stem anchors it to the rich earth below, out of\\nwhich it has power to draw the nourishment that makes it so lovely\\nand keeps it spotless--unless slugs and flies and boys spoil it,”\\n added Miss Scott as she watched Mr. Fred poke and splash with his\\ncane after a half-closed flower.\\n\\n“The naughty things have all shut up and spoilt the pretty sight;\\nI’m so disappointed,” sighed Miss Ellery, surveying the green buds\\nwith great disfavor as she had planned to wear some in her hair and\\nact Undine.\\n\\n“You must come early in the morning if you want to see them at their\\nbest. I’ve read somewhere that when the sun first strikes them they\\nopen rapidly, and it is a lovely sight. I shall try to see it some\\nday if I can get here in time,” said Miss Scott.\\n\\n“How romantic old maids are!” whispered one girl to another.\\n\\n“So are young ones; hear what Floss Ellery is saying,” answered the\\nother; and both giggled under their big hats as they caught these\\nwords followed by the rippling laugh,--\\n\\n“All flowers open and show their hearts when the sun shines on them\\nat the right moment.”\\n\\n“I wish human flowers would,” murmured Mr. Fred; and then, as if\\nrather alarmed at his own remark, he added hastily, “I’ll get that\\nbig lily out there and MAKE it bloom for you.”\\n\\nTrusting to an old log that lay in the pond, he went to the end and\\nbent to pull in the half-shut flower; but this too ardent sun was\\nnot to make it blossom, for his foot slipped and down he went up to\\nhis knees in mud and water.\\n\\n“Save him! oh, save him!” shrieked Miss Ellery, clutching Captain\\nJohn, who was laughing like a boy, while the other lads shouted and\\nthe girls added their shrill merriment as poor Fred scrambled to the\\nshore a wreck of the gallant craft that had set sail in spotless\\nwhite.\\n\\n“What the deuce shall I do?” he asked in a tone of despair as they\\nflocked about him to condole even while they laughed.\\n\\n“Roll up your trousers and borrow Sam’s boots. The old lady will dry\\nyour shoes and socks while you are at supper, and have them ready to\\nwear home,” suggested Captain John, who was used to duckings and\\nmade light of them.\\n\\nThe word “supper” made one carnal-minded youth sniff the air and\\nannounce that he smelt “something good;” and at once every one\\nturned toward the picnic ground, like chickens hurrying to the barn\\nat feeding-time. Fred vanished into the cottage, and the rest\\ngathered about the great fire of driftwood fast turning to clear\\ncoals, over which Ruth was beginning her long hot task. She wore a\\nbig apron, a red handkerchief over her head, had her sleeves rolled\\nup, and was so intent on her work that she merely nodded and smiled\\nas the new-comers greeted her with varying degrees of courtesy.\\n\\n“She looks like a handsome gypsy, with her dark face and that red\\nthing in the firelight. I wish I could paint her,” said Miss Scott,\\nwho was very young at heart in spite of her fifty years and gray\\nhead.\\n\\n“So do I, but we can remember it. I do like to see a girl work with\\na will, even at frying fish. Most of ‘em dawdle so at the few things\\nthey try to do. There’s a piece of energy for you!” and Captain John\\nleaned forward from his rocky seat to watch Ruth, who just then\\ncaught up the coffee-pot about to boil over, and with the other hand\\nsaved her frying-pan from capsizing on its unsteady bed of coals.\\n\\n“She is a nice girl, and I’m much interested in her. Mr. Wallace\\nsays he will tell us her story by-and-by if we care to hear it. He\\nhas known the old man a long time.”\\n\\n“Don’t forget to remind him, Aunty. I like a yarn after mess;” and\\nCaptain John went off to bring the first plate of fish to the dear\\nold lady who had been a mother to him for many years.\\n\\nIt was a merry supper, and the moon was up before it ended; for\\neverything “tasted so good” the hearty young appetites sharpened by\\nsea air were hard to satisfy. When the last cunner had vanished and\\nnothing but olives and oyster crackers remained, the party settled\\non a sloping rock out of range of the fire, and reposed for a brief\\nperiod to recover from the exertions of the feast, having, like the\\nheroes in the old story, “eaten mightily for the space of an hour.”\\n\\nMr. Fred in the capacious boots was a never-failing source of\\namusement, and consequently somewhat subdued. But Miss Ellery\\nconsoled him, and much food sustained him till his shoes were dry.\\nRuth remained to clear up, and Sammy to gorge himself on the\\nremnants of “sweet cake” which he could not bear to see wasted. So,\\nwhen some one proposed telling stories till they were ready to sing,\\nMr. Wallace was begged to begin.\\n\\n“It is only something about this island, but you may like to hear it\\njust now,” said the genial old gentleman, settling his handkerchief\\nover his bald head for fear of cold, and glancing at the attentive\\nyoung faces grouped about him in the moonlight.\\n\\n“Some twenty years ago there was a wreck over there on those great\\nrocks; you fellows have heard about it, so I’ll only say that a very\\nbrave sailor, a native of the Port here, swam out with a rope and\\nsaved a dozen men and women. I’ll call him Sam. Well, one of the\\nwomen was an English governess, and when the lady she was with went\\non her way after the wreck, this pretty girl (who by the way was a\\ngood deal hurt trying to save the child she had in charge) was left\\nbehind to recover, and--”\\n\\n“Marry the brave sailor of course,” cried one of the girls.\\n\\n“Exactly! and a very happy pair they were. She had no family who\\nwanted her at home; her father had been a clergyman, I believe, and\\nshe was well born, but Sam was a fine fellow and earned his living\\nhonestly, fishing off the Banks, as half the men do here. Well, they\\nwere very happy, had two children, and were saving up a bit, when\\npoor Sam and two brothers were lost in one of the great storms which\\nnow and then make widows and orphans by the dozen. It killed the\\nwife; but Sam’s father, who kept the lighthouse here then, took the\\npoor children and supported them for ten years. The boy was a mere\\nbaby; the girl a fine creature, brave like her father, handsome like\\nher mother, and with a good deal of the lady about her, though every\\none didn’t find it out.”\\n\\n“Ahem!” cried the sharp girl, who began to understand the point of\\nthe story now, but would not spoil it, as the others seemed still in\\nthe dark, though Miss Scott was smiling, and Captain John staring\\nhard at the old gentleman in the blue silk nightcap.\\n\\n“Got a fly in your throat?” asked a neighbor; but Kate only laughed\\nand begged pardon for interrupting.\\n\\n“There’s not much more; only that affair was rather romantic, and\\none can’t help wondering how the children turned out. Storms seem to\\nhave been their doom, for in the terrible one we had two winters\\nago, the old lighthouse keeper had a bad fall on the icy rocks, and\\nif it had not been for the girl, the light would have gone out and\\nmore ships been lost on this dangerous point. The keeper’s mate had\\ngone ashore and couldn’t get back for two days, the gale raged so\\nfiercely; but he knew Ben could get on without him, as he had the\\ngirl and boy over for a visit. In winter they lived with a friend\\nand went to school at the Port. It would have been all right if Ben\\nhadn’t broken his ribs. But he was a stout old salt; so he told the\\ngirl what to do, and she did it, while the boy waited on the sick\\nman. For two days and nights that brave creature lived in the tower,\\nthat often rocked as if it would come down, while the sleet and snow\\ndimmed the lantern, and sea-birds were beaten to death against the\\nglass. But the light burned steadily, and people said, ‘All is\\nwell,’ as ships steered away in time, when the clear light warned\\nthem of danger, and grateful sailors blessed the hands that kept it\\nburning faithfully.”\\n\\n“I hope she got rewarded,” cried an eager voice, as the story-teller\\npaused for breath.\\n\\n“‘I only did my duty; that is reward enough,’ she said, when some of\\nthe rich men at the Port heard of it and sent her money and thanks.\\nShe took the money, however, for Ben had to give up the place, being\\ntoo lame to do the work. He earns his living by fishing now, and\\nputs away most of his pension for the children. He won’t last long,\\nand then they must take care of themselves; for the old woman is no\\nrelation, and the girl is too proud to hunt up the forgetful English\\nfriends, if they have any. But I don’t fear for her; a brave lass\\nlike that will make her own way anywhere.”\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked several voices, as Mr. Wallace leaned back and\\nfanned himself with his hat.\\n\\n“That’s all of the first and second parts; the third is yet to come.\\nWhen I know it, I’ll tell you; perhaps next summer, if we meet here\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Then you know the girl? What is she doing now?” asked Miss Ellery,\\nwho had lost a part of the story as she sat in a shadowy nook with\\nthe pensive Fred.\\n\\n“We all know her. She is washing a coffee-pot at this moment, I\\nbelieve;” and Mr. Wallace pointed to a figure on the beach,\\nenergetically shaking a large tin article that shone in the\\nmoonlight.\\n\\n“Ruth? Really? How romantic and interesting!” exclaimed Miss Ellery,\\nwho was just of the age, as were most of the other girls, to enjoy\\ntales of this sort and imagine sensational denouements.\\n\\n“There is a great deal of untold romance in the lives of these\\ntoilers of the sea, and I am sure this good girl will find her\\nreward for the care she takes of the old man and the boy. It costs\\nher something, I’ve discovered, for she wants an education, and\\ncould get it if she left this poor place and lived for herself; but\\nshe won’t go, and works hard to get money for Grandpa’s comfort,\\ninstead of buying the books she longs for. I think, young ladies,\\nthat there is real heroism in cheerfully selling lilies and frying\\nfish for duty’s sake when one longs to be studying, and enjoying a\\nlittle of the youth that comes but once,” said Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes, so nice of her! We might take up a contribution for\\nher when we get home. I’ll head the paper with pleasure and give all\\nI can afford, for it must be so horrid to be ignorant at her age. I\\ndare say the poor thing can’t even read; just fancy!” and Miss\\nEllery clasped her hands with a sigh of pity.\\n\\n“Very few girls can read fit to be heard now-a-days,” murmured Miss\\nScott.\\n\\n“Don’t let them affront her with their money; she will fling it in\\ntheir faces as she did that donkey’s dollar. You see to her in your\\nnice, delicate way, Aunty, and give her a lift if she will let you,”\\n whispered Captain John in the old lady’s ear.\\n\\n“Don’t waste your pity, Miss Florence. Ruth reads a newspaper better\\nthan any woman I ever knew. I’ve heard her doing it to the old man,\\ngetting through shipping news, money-market, and politics in fine\\nstyle. I wouldn’t offer her money if I were you, though it is a kind\\nthought. These people have an honest pride in earning things for\\nthemselves, and I respect them for it,” added Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Dear me! I should as soon think of a sand skipper having pride as\\none of these fishy folks in this stupid little place,” observed Mr.\\nFred, moving his legs into the shadow as the creeping moonlight\\nbegan to reveal the hideous boots.\\n\\n“Why not? I think they have more to be proud of, these brave,\\nhonest, independent people, than many who never earn a cent and\\nswell round on the money their fathers made out of pork, rum,\\nor--any other rather unpleasant or disreputable business,” said\\nCaptain John, with the twinkle in his eye, as he changed the end of\\nhis sentence, for the word “pickles” was on his lips when Aunt\\nMary’s quick touch checked it. Some saucy girl laughed, and Mr. Fred\\nsquirmed, for it was well known that his respectable grandfather\\nwhom he never mentioned had made his large fortune in a\\npickle-factory.\\n\\n“We all rise from the mud in one sense, and all may be handsome\\nflowers if we choose before we go back, after blooming, to ripen our\\nseeds at the bottom of the water where we began,” said Miss Scott’s\\nrefined voice, sounding softly after the masculine ones.\\n\\n“I like that idea! Thank you, Aunt Mary, for giving me such a pretty\\nfancy to add to my love for water-lilies. I shall remember it, and\\ntry to be a lovely one, not a bit ashamed to own that I came from\\nhonest farmer stock,” exclaimed the thoughtful girl who had learned\\nto know and love the sweet, wise woman who was so motherly to all\\ngirls.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried Captain John, heartily; for he was very proud of\\nhis own brave name kept clean and bright through a long line of\\nsailor kin.\\n\\n“Now let us sing or we shall have no time,” suggested Miss Ellery,\\nwho warbled as well as rippled, and did not wish to lose this\\nopportunity of singing certain sentimental songs appropriate to the\\nhour.\\n\\nSo they tuned their pipes and made “music in the air” for an hour,\\nto the great delight of Sammy, who joined in every song, and was\\neasily persuaded to give sundry nautical melodies in a shrill small\\nvoice which convulsed his hearers with merriment.\\n\\n“Ruth sings awful well, but she won’t afore folks,” he said, as he\\npaused after a roaring ditty.\\n\\n“She will for me;” and Mr. Wallace went slowly up to the rock not\\nfar away, where Ruth sat alone listening to the music as she rested\\nafter her long day’s work.\\n\\n“Such airs!” said Miss Ellery, in a sharp tone; for her “Wind of the\\nSummer Night” had not gone well, owing to a too copious supper.\\n“Posing for Lorelei,” she added, as Ruth began to sing, glad to\\noblige the kind old gentleman. They expected some queer ballad or\\ndroning hymn, and were surprised when a clear sweet voice gave them\\n“The Three Fishers” and “Mary on the Sands of Dee” with a simple\\npathos that made real music-lovers thrill with pleasure, and filled\\nseveral pairs of eyes with tears.\\n\\n“More, please, more!” called Captain John, as she paused; and as if\\nencouraged by the hearty applause her one gift excited, she sang on\\nas easily as a bird till her small store was exhausted.\\n\\n“I call THAT music,” said Miss Scott, as she wiped her eyes with a\\nsigh of satisfaction. “It comes from the heart and goes to the\\nheart, as it should. Now we don’t want anything else, and had better\\ngo home while the spell lasts.”\\n\\nMost of the party followed her example, and went to thank and say\\ngood-night to Ruth, who felt as rich and happy as a queen with the\\nmoney Mr. Wallace had slipped into her pocket, and the pleasure\\nwhich even this short glimpse of a higher, happier life had brought\\nher hungry nature.\\n\\nAs the boats floated away, leaving her alone on the shore, she sent\\nher farewell ringing over the water in the words of the old song, “A\\nLife on the Ocean Wave;” and every one joined in it with a will,\\nespecially Mr. Wallace and Captain John; and so the evening picnic\\nended tunefully and pleasantly for all, and was long remembered by\\nseveral.\\n\\nAfter that day many “good times” came to Ruth and Sammy; and even\\npoor old Grandpa had his share, finding the last summer of his life\\nvery smooth sailing as he slowly drifted into port. It seemed quite\\nnatural that Captain John, being a sailor, should like to go and\\nread and “yarn” with the old fisherman; so no one wondered when he\\nfell into the way of rowing over to the Island very often with his\\npocket full of newspapers, and whiling away the long hours in the\\nlittle house as full of sea smells and salt breezes as a shell on\\nthe shore.\\n\\nMiss Scott also took a fancy to go with her nephew; for, being an\\nardent botanist, she discovered that the Island possessed many\\nplants which she could not find on the rocky point of land where the\\nhotel and cottages stood. The fresh-water pond was her especial\\ndelight, and it became a sort of joke to ask, when she came home\\nbrown and beaming with her treasures in tin boxes, bottles, and\\nbunches,--\\n\\n“Well, Aunt Mary, have you seen the water-lilies bloom yet?” and\\nshe always answered with that wise smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Not yet, but I’m biding my time, and am watching a very fine one\\nwith especial interest. When the right moment comes, it will bloom\\nand show its golden heart to me, I hope.”\\n\\nRuth never quite knew how it came about, but books seemed to find\\ntheir way to the Island and stay there, to her great delight. A\\ndemand for lilies sprang up, and when their day was over\\nmarsh-rosemary became the rage. Sammy found a market for all the\\nshells and gulls’ wings he could furnish, and certain old\\ncuriosities brought from many voyages were sold for sums which added\\nmany comforts to the old sailor’s last cruise.\\n\\nNow the daily row to the Point was a pleasure, not a trial, to\\nRuth,--for Mr. Wallace was always ready with a kind word or gift,\\nthe ladies nodded as she passed, and asked how the old Skipper was\\nto-day; Miss Scott often told her to stop at the cottage for some\\nnew book or a moment’s chat on her way to the boat, and Captain John\\nhelped Sammy with his fishing so much that the baskets were always\\nfull when they came home.\\n\\nAll this help and friendliness put a wonderful energy and sweetness\\ninto Ruth’s hard life, and made her work seem light, her patient\\nwaiting for freedom easier to bear cheerfully. She sang as she stood\\nover her wash-tub, cheered the long nights of watching with the\\nprecious books, and found the few moments of rest that came to her\\nwhen the day’s work was done very pleasant, as she sat on her rock,\\nwatching the lights from the Point, catching the sound of gay music\\nas the young people danced, and thinking over the delightful talks\\nshe had with Miss Scott. Perhaps the presence of a blue jacket in\\nGrandpa’s little bedroom, the sight of a friendly brown face smiling\\nwhen she came in, and the sonorous murmur of a man’s voice reading\\naloud, added a charm to the girl’s humdrum life. She was too\\ninnocent and frank to deny that she enjoyed these new friends, and\\nwelcomed both with the same eagerness, saw both go with the same\\nregret, and often wondered how she ever had got on without them.\\n\\nBut the modest fisher-maiden never dreamed of any warmer feeling\\nthan kindness on the one side and gratitude on the other; and this\\nunconsciousness was her greatest charm, especially to Captain John,\\nwho hated coquettes, and shunned the silly girls who wasted time in\\nidle flirtation when they had far better and wholesomer pastimes to\\nenjoy. The handsome sailor was a favorite, being handy at all sorts\\nof fun, and the oldest of the young men at the Point. He was very\\ncourteous in his hearty way to every woman he met, from the\\nstateliest dowager to the dowdiest waiter-girl, but devoted himself\\nentirely to Aunt Mary, and seemed to have no eyes for younger fairer\\nfaces.\\n\\n“He must have a sweetheart over the sea somewhere,” the damsels said\\namong themselves, as they watched him pace the long piazzas alone,\\nor saw him swinging in his hammock with eyes dreamily fixed on the\\nblue bay before him.\\n\\nMiss Scott only smiled when curious questions were asked her, and\\nsaid she hoped John would find his mate some time, for he deserved\\nthe best wife in the world, having been a good son and an honest boy\\nfor six-and-twenty years.\\n\\n“What is it, Captain,--a steamer?” asked Mr. Fred, as he came by the\\ncottage one August afternoon, with his usual escort of girls, all\\ntalking at once about some very interesting affair.\\n\\n“Only a sail-boat; no steamers to-day,” answered Captain John,\\ndropping the glass from his eye with a start.\\n\\n“Can you see people on the Island with that thing? We want to know\\nif Ruth is at home, because if she isn’t we can’t waste time going\\nover,” said Miss Ellery, with her sweetest smile.\\n\\n“I think not. That boat is Sammy’s, and as there is a speck of red\\naboard, I fancy Miss Ruth is with him. They are coming this way, so\\nyou can hail them if you like,” answered the sailor, with “a speck\\nof red” on his own sunburnt cheek if any one had cared to look.\\n\\n“Then we’ll wait here if we may. We ordered her to bring us a\\nquantity of bulrushes and flowers for our tableaux to-night, and we\\nwant her to be Rebecca at the well. She is so dark, and with her\\nhair down, and gold bangles and scarlet shawls, I think she would do\\nnicely. It takes so long to arrange the ‘Lily Maid of Astolat’ we\\nMUST have an easy one to come just before that, and the boys are\\nwild to make a camel of themselves, so we planned this. Won’t you be\\nJacob or Abraham or whoever the man with the bracelets was?” asked\\nMiss Ellery, as they all settled on the steps in the free-and-easy\\nway which prevailed at the Point.\\n\\n“No, thank you, I don’t act. Used to dance hornpipes in my young\\ndays, but gave up that sort of thing some time ago.”\\n\\n“How unfortunate! Every one acts; it’s all the fashion,” began Miss\\nEllery, rolling up her blue eyes imploringly.\\n\\n“So I see; but I never cared much for theatricals, I like natural\\nthings better.”\\n\\n“How unkind you are! I quite depended on you for that, since you\\nwouldn’t be a corsair.”\\n\\n“Fred’s the man for such fun. He’s going to startle the crowd with a\\nregular Captain Kidd rig, pistols and cutlasses enough for a whole\\ncrew, and a terrific beard.”\\n\\n“I know Ruth won’t do it, Floss, for she looked amazed when I showed\\nher my Undine costume, and told her what I wanted the sea-weed for.\\n‘Why, you won’t stand before all those folks dressed that way, will\\nyou?’ she said, as much scandalized as if she’d never seen a\\nlow-necked dress and silk stockings before;” and Miss Perry tossed\\nher head with an air of pity for a girl who could be surprised at\\nthe display of a pretty neck and arms and ankles.\\n\\n“We’ll HIRE her, then; she’s a mercenary wretch and will do anything\\nfor money. I won’t be scrambled into my boat in a hurry, and we MUST\\nhave Rebecca because I’ve borrowed a fine pitcher and promised the\\nboys their camel,” said Miss Ellery, who considered herself the\\nqueen of the place and ruled like one, in virtue of being the\\nprettiest girl there and the richest.\\n\\n“She has landed, I think, for the boat is off again to the wharf.\\nBetter run down and help her with the bulrushes, Fred, and the rest\\nof the stuff you ordered,” suggested Captain John, longing to go\\nhimself but kept by his duty as host, Aunt Mary being asleep\\nupstairs.\\n\\n“Too tired. Won’t hurt her; she’s used to work, and we mustn’t\\npamper her up, as old ladies say,” answered Mr. Fred, enjoying his\\nfavorite lounge on the grass.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t ask her to act, if you’ll allow me to say so,” said\\nCaptain John, in his quiet way. “That sort of thing might unsettle\\nher and make her discontented. She steers that little craft over\\nthere and is happy now; let her shape her own course, and remember\\nit isn’t well to talk to the man at the wheel.”\\n\\nMiss Perry stared; Miss Ray, the sharp girl, nodded, and Miss Ellery\\nsaid petulantly,--\\n\\n“As if it mattered what SHE thought or said or did! It’s her place\\nto be useful if we want her, and we needn’t worry about spoiling a\\ngirl like that. She can’t be any prouder or more saucy than she is,\\nand I shall ask her if only to see the airs she will put on.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ruth came up the sandy path from the beach laden with\\nrushes and weeds, sun-flowers and shells, looking warm and tired\\nbut more picturesque than ever, in her blue gown and the red\\nhandkerchief she wore since her old hat blew away. Seeing the party\\non the cottage steps, she stopped to ask if the things were right,\\nand Miss Ellery at once made her request in a commanding tone which\\ncaused Ruth to grow very straight and cool and sober all at once,\\nand answer decidedly,--\\n\\n“I couldn’t anyway.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Well, one reason is I don’t think it’s right to act things out of\\nthe Bible just to show off and amuse folks.”\\n\\n“The idea of minding!” and Miss Ellery frowned, adding angrily, “We\\nwill pay you for it. I find people will do anything for money down\\nhere.”\\n\\n“We are poor and need it, and this is our best time to make it. I’d\\ndo most anything to earn a little, but not that;” and Ruth looked as\\nproud as the young lady herself.\\n\\n“Then we’ll say no more if you are too elegant to do what WE don’t\\nmind at all. I’ll pay you for this stuff now, as I ordered it, and\\nyou needn’t bring me any more. How much do I owe you?” asked the\\noffended beauty, taking out her purse in a pet.\\n\\n“Nothing. I’m glad to oblige the ladies if I can, for they have been\\nvery kind to me. Perhaps if you knew why I want to earn money, you’d\\nunderstand me better. Grandpa can’t last long, and I don’t want the\\ntown to bury him. I’m working and saving so he can be buried\\ndecently, as he wants to be, not like a pauper.”\\n\\nThere was something in Ruth’s face and voice as she said this,\\nstanding there shabby, tired, and heavy-laden, yet honest, dutiful\\nand patient for love’s sake, that touched the hearts of those who\\nlooked and listened; but she left no time for any answer, for with\\nthe last word she went on quickly, as if to hide the tears that\\ndimmed her clear eyes and the quiver of her lips.\\n\\n“Floss, how could you!” cried Miss Ray, and ran to take the sheaf of\\nbulrushes from Ruth’s arms, followed by the rest, all ashamed and\\nrepentant now that a word had shown them the hard life going on\\nbeside their idle, care-free ones.\\n\\nCaptain John longed to follow, but walked into the house, growling\\nto himself with a grim look,--\\n\\n“That girl has no more heart than a butterfly, and I’d like to see\\nher squirm on a pin! Poor Ruth! we’ll settle that matter, and bury\\nold Ben like an admiral, hang me if we don’t!”\\n\\nHe was so busy talking the affair over with Aunt Mary that he did\\nnot see the girl flit by to wait for her boat on the beach, having\\nsteadily refused the money offered her, though she accepted the\\napologies in the kindest spirit.\\n\\nThe beach at this hour of the day was left to the nurses and maids\\nwho bathed and gossiped while the little people played in the sand\\nor paddled in the sea. Several were splashing about, and one German\\ngoverness was scolding violently because while she was in the\\nbath-house her charge, a little girl of six, had rashly ventured out\\nin a flat-bottomed tub, as they called the small boats used by the\\ngentlemen to reach the yachts anchored in deep water.\\n\\nRuth saw the child’s danger at a glance, for the tide was going out,\\ncarrying the frail cockleshell rapidly away, while the child risked\\nan upset every moment by stretching her arms to the women on the\\nshore and calling them to help her.\\n\\nNone dared to try, but all stood and wrung their hands, screaming\\nlike sea-gulls, till the girl, throwing off shoes and heavy skirt\\nplunged in, calling cheerily, “Sit still! I’ll come and get you,\\nMilly!”\\n\\nShe could swim like a fish, but encumbered with her clothes and\\nweary with an unusually hard day’s work, she soon found that she did\\nnot gain as rapidly as she expected upon the receding boat. She did\\nnot lose courage, but a thrill of anxiety shot through her as she\\nfelt her breath grow short, her limbs heavy, and the tide sweep her\\nfarther and farther from the shore.\\n\\n“If they would only stop screaming and go for help, I could keep up\\nand push the boat in; but the child will be out presently and then\\nwe are lost, for I can’t get back with her, I’m afraid.”\\n\\nAs these thoughts passed through her mind Ruth was swimming stoutly,\\nand trying by cheerful words to keep the frightened child from\\nrisking their main chance of safety. A few more strokes and she\\nwould reach the boat, rest a moment, then, clinging to it, push it\\nleisurely to shore. Feeling that the danger was over, she hurried on\\nand was just putting up her hands to seize the frail raft and get\\nher breath when Milly, thinking she was to be taken in her arms,\\nleaned forward. In rushed the water, down went the boat, and out\\nsplashed the screaming child to cling to Ruth with the desperate\\nclutch she dreaded.\\n\\nBoth went under for a moment, but rose again; and with all her wits\\nsharpened by the peril of the moment, Ruth cried, as she kept\\nherself afloat,--\\n\\n“On my back, quick! quick! Don’t touch my arms; hold tight to my\\nhair, and keep still.”\\n\\nNot realizing all the danger, and full of faith in Ruth’s power to\\ndo anything, after the feats of diving and floating she had seen her\\nperform, Milly scrambled up as often before, and clung spluttering\\nand gasping to Ruth’s strong shoulders. So burdened, and conscious\\nof fast-failing strength, Ruth turned toward the shore, and bent\\nevery power of mind and body to her task. How far away it seemed!\\nhow still the women were,--not one even venturing out a little way\\nto help her, and no man in sight! Her heart seemed to stop beating,\\nher temples throbbed, her breath was checked by the clinging arms,\\nand the child, seemed to grow heavier every moment.\\n\\n“I’ll do what I can, but, oh, why don’t some one come?”\\n\\nThat was the last thought Ruth was conscious of, as she panted and\\nploughed slowly back, with such a set white face and wide eyes fixed\\non the flag that fluttered from the nearest cottage, that it was no\\nwonder the women grew still as they watched her. One good Catholic\\nnurse fell on her knees to pray; the maids cried, the governess\\nmurmured, “Mein Gott, I am lost if the child go drowned!” and clear\\nand sweet came the sound of Captain John’s whistle as he stood on\\nhis piazza waiting to row Ruth home.\\n\\nThey were nearly in, a few more strokes and she could touch the\\nbottom, when suddenly all grew black before her eyes, and\\nwhispering, “I’ll float. Call, Milly, and don’t mind me,” Ruth\\nturned over, still holding the child fast, and with nothing but her\\nface out of water, feebly struggled on.\\n\\n“Come and get me! She’s going down! Oh, come, quick!” called the\\nchild in a tone of such distress that the selfish German bestirred\\nherself at last, and began to wade cautiously in. Seeing help at\\nhand, brave little Milly soon let go, and struck out like an\\nenergetic young frog, while Ruth, quite spent, sank quietly down,\\nwith a dim sense that her last duty was done and rest had come.\\n\\nThe shrill cries of the women when they saw the steady white face\\ndisappear and rise no more, reached Captain John’s ear, and sent him\\nflying down the path, sure that some one was in danger.\\n\\n“Ruth--gone down--out there!” was all he caught, as many voices\\ntried to tell the tale; and waiting for no more, he threw off hat\\nand coat, and dashed into the sea as if ready to search the Atlantic\\ntill he found her.\\n\\nShe was safe in a moment, and pausing only to send one girl flying\\nfor the doctor, he carried his streaming burden straight home to\\nAunt Mary, who had her between blankets before a soul arrived, and\\nwas rubbing for dear life while John fired up the spirit lamp for\\nhot brandy and water, with hands that trembled as he splashed about\\nlike an agitated Newfoundland fresh from a swim.\\n\\nRuth was soon conscious, but too much exhausted to do or say\\nanything, and lay quietly suffering the discomforts of resuscitation\\ntill she fell asleep.\\n\\n“Is Milly safe?” was all she asked, and being assured that the child\\nwas in her mother’s arms, and Sammy had gone to tell Grandpa all\\nabout it, she smiled and shut her eyes with a whispered, “Then it’s\\nall right, thank God!”\\n\\nAll that evening Captain John paced the piazza, and warned away the\\neager callers, who flocked down to ask about the heroine of the\\nhour; for she was more interesting than Undine, the Lily Maid, or\\nany of the pretty creatures attitudinizing behind the red curtains\\nin the hot hotel parlor. All that night Aunt Mary watched the deep\\nsleep that restored the girl, and now and then crept out to tell her\\nnephew there was nothing to fear for one so strong and healthful.\\nAnd all night Ruth dreamed strange dreams, some weird and dim, some\\nfull of pain and fear; but as the fever of reaction passed away,\\nlovely visions of a happy place came to her, where faces she loved\\nwere near, and rest, and all she longed for was hers at last. So\\nclear and beautiful was this dream that she waked in the early dawn\\nto lie and think of it, with such a look of peace upon her face that\\nAunt Mary could not but kiss it tenderly when she came in to see if\\nall was well.\\n\\n“How are you, dear? Has this nice long sleep set you up again as I\\nhoped?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’m quite well, thank you, and I must go home. Grandpa will\\nworry so till he sees me,” answered Ruth, sitting up with her wet\\nhair on her shoulders, and a little shiver of pain as she stretched\\nher tired arms.\\n\\n“Not yet, my dear; rest another hour or two and have some breakfast.\\nThen, if you like, John shall take you home before any one comes to\\nplague you with idle questions. I’m not going to say a word, except\\nthat I’m proud of my brave girl, and mean to take care of her if she\\nwill let me.”\\n\\nWith that and a motherly embrace, the old lady bustled away to stir\\nup her maid and wake John from his first nap with the smell of\\ncoffee, a most unromantic but satisfying perfume to all the weary\\nwatchers in the house.\\n\\nAn hour later, dressed in Miss Scott’s gray wrapper and rose-colored\\nshawl, Ruth came slowly to the beach leaning on Captain John’s arm,\\nwhile Aunt Mary waved her napkin from the rocks above, and sent kind\\nmessages after them as they pushed off.\\n\\nIt was the loveliest hour of all the day. The sun had not yet risen,\\nbut sea and sky were rosy with the flush of dawn; the small waves\\nrippled up the sand, the wind blew fresh and fragrant from hayfields\\nfar away, and in the grove the birds were singing, as they only sing\\nat peep of day. A still, soft, happy time before the work and worry\\nof the world began, the peaceful moment which is so precious to\\nthose who have learned to love its balm and consecrate its beauty\\nwith their prayers.\\n\\nRuth sat silent, looking about her as if she saw a new heaven and\\nearth, and had no words in which to tell the feeling that made her\\neyes so soft, sent the fresh color back into her cheeks, and touched\\nher lips with something sweeter than a smile.\\n\\nCaptain John rowed very slowly, watching her with a new expression\\nin his face; and when she drew a long breath, a happy sort of sigh,\\nhe leaned forward to ask, as if he knew what brought it,--\\n\\n“You are glad to be alive, Ruth?”\\n\\n“Oh, so glad! I didn’t want to die; life’s very pleasant now,” she\\nanswered, with her frank eyes meeting his so gratefully.\\n\\n“Even though it’s hard?”\\n\\n“It’s easier lately; you and dear Miss Mary have helped so much, I\\nsee my way clear, and mean to go right on, real brave and cheerful,\\nsure I’ll get my wish at last.”\\n\\n“So do I!” and Captain John laughed a queer, happy laugh, as he bent\\nto his oars again, with the look of a man who knew where he was\\ngoing and longed to get there as soon as possible.\\n\\n“I hope you will. I wish I could help anyway to pay for all you’ve\\ndone for me. I know you don’t want to be thanked for fishing me up,\\nbut I mean to do it all the same, if I can, some time;” and Ruth’s\\nvoice was full of tender energy as she looked down into the deep\\ngreen water where her life would have ended but for him.\\n\\n“What did you think of when you went down so quietly? Those women\\nsaid you never called for help once.”\\n\\n“I had no breath to call. I knew you were near, I hoped you’d come,\\nand I thought of poor Grandpa and Sammy as I gave up and seemed to\\ngo to sleep.”\\n\\nA very simple answer, but it made Captain John beam with delight;\\nand the morning red seemed to glow all over his brown face as he\\nrowed across the quiet bay, looking at Ruth sitting opposite, so\\nchanged by the soft becoming colors of her dress, the late danger,\\nand the dreams that still lingered in her mind, making it hard to\\nfeel that she was the same girl who went that way only a day ago.\\n\\nPresently the Captain spoke again in a tone that was both eager and\\nanxious,--\\n\\n“I’m glad my idle summer hasn’t been quite wasted. It’s over now,\\nand I’m off in a few days for a year’s cruise, you know.”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Mary told me you were going soon. I’ll miss you both, but\\nmaybe you’ll come next year?”\\n\\n“I will, please God!”\\n\\n“So will I; for even if I get away this fall, I’d love to come again\\nin summer and rest a little while, no matter what I find to do.”\\n\\n“Come and stay with Aunt Mary if this home is gone. I shall want\\nSammy next time. I’ve settled that with the Skipper, you know, and\\nI’ll take good care of the little chap. He’s not much younger than I\\nwas when I shipped for my first voyage. You’ll let him go?”\\n\\n“Anywhere with you. He’s set his heart on being a sailor, and\\nGrandpa likes it. All our men are, and I’d be one if I were a boy. I\\nlove the sea so, I couldn’t be happy long away from it.”\\n\\n“Even though it nearly drowned you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I’d rather die that way than any other. But it was my fault; I\\nshouldn’t have failed if I hadn’t been so tired. I’ve often swum\\nfarther; but I’d been three hours in the marsh getting those things\\nfor the girls, and it was washing-day, and I’d been up nearly all\\nnight with Grandpa; so don’t blame the sea, please, Captain John.”\\n\\n“You should have called me; I was waiting for you, Ruth.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know it. I’m used to doing things myself. It might have\\nbeen too late for Milly if I’d waited.”\\n\\n“Thank God, I wasn’t too late for you.”\\n\\nThe boat was at the shore now; and as he spoke Captain John held out\\nhis hands to help Ruth down, for, encumbered with her long dress,\\nand still weak from past suffering, she could not spring to land as\\nshe used to do in her short gown. For the first time the color\\ndeepened in her cheek as she looked into the face before her and\\nread the meaning of the eyes that found her beautiful and dear, and\\nthe lips that thanked God for her salvation so fervently.\\n\\nShe did not speak, but let him lift her down, draw her hand through\\nhis arm, and lead her up the rocky slope to the little pool that lay\\nwaiting for the sun’s first rays to wake from its sleep. He paused\\nthere, and with his hand on hers said quietly,--\\n\\n“Ruth, before I go I want to tell you something, and this is a good\\ntime and place. While Aunt Mary watched the flowers, I’ve watched\\nyou, and found the girl I’ve always wanted for my wife. Modest and\\nbrave, dutiful and true, that’s what I love; could you give me all\\nthis, dear, for the little I can offer, and next year sail with\\nSammy and a very happy man if you say yes?”\\n\\n“I’m not half good and wise enough for that! Remember what I am,”\\n began Ruth, bending her head as if the thought were more than she\\ncould bear.\\n\\n“I do remember, and I’m proud of it! Why, dear heart, I’ve worked my\\nway up from a common sailor, and am the better for it. Now I’ve got\\nmy ship, and I want a mate to make a home for me aboard and ashore.\\nLook up and tell me that I didn’t read those true eyes wrong.”\\n\\nThen Ruth lifted up her face, and the sunshine showed him all he\\nasked to know, as she answered with her heart in her voice and the\\n“true eyes” fixed on his,--\\n\\n“I tried not to love you, knowing what a poor ignorant girl I am;\\nbut you were so kind to me, how could I help it, John?”\\n\\nThat satisfied him, and he sealed his happy thanks on the innocent\\nlips none had kissed but the little brother, the old man, and the\\nfresh winds of the sea.\\n\\nOne can imagine the welcome they met at the small brown house, and\\nwhat went on inside as Grandpa blessed the lovers, and Sammy so\\noverflowed with joy at his enchanting prospects, that he was obliged\\nto vent his feelings in ecstatic jigs upon the beach, to the great\\namazement of the gulls and sandpipers at breakfast there.\\n\\nNo one at the Point, except a certain dear old lady, knew the\\npleasant secret, though many curious or friendly visitors went to\\nthe Island that day to see the heroine and express their wonder,\\nthanks, and admiration. All agreed that partial drowning seemed to\\nsuit the girl, for a new Ruth had risen like Venus from the sea. A\\nsofter beauty was in her fresh face now, a gentler sort of pride\\npossessed her, and a still more modest shrinking from praise and\\npublicity became her well. No one guessed the cause, and she was\\nsoon forgotten; for the season was over, the summer guests departed,\\nand the Point was left to the few cottagers who loved to linger into\\ngolden September.\\n\\nMiss Mary was one of these, and Captain John another; for he\\nremained as long as he dared, to make things comfortable for the old\\nman, and to sit among the rocks with Ruth when her day’s work was\\ndone, listening while his “Mermaid,” as he called her, sang as she\\nhad never sung before, and let him read the heart he had made his\\nown, for the lily was wide open now, and its gold all his.\\n\\nWith the first frosts Grandpa died, and was carried to his grave by\\nhis old comrades, owing no man a cent, thanks to his dutiful\\ngranddaughter and the new son she had given him. Then the little\\nhouse was deserted, and all winter Ruth was happy with Aunt Mary,\\nwhile Sammy studied bravely, and lived on dreams of the joys in\\nstore for him when the Captain came sailing home again.\\n\\nAnother summer brought the happy day when the little brown house was\\nset in order for a sailor’s honeymoon, when the flag floated gayly\\nover Miss Mary’s cottage, and Ruth in a white gown with her chosen\\nflowers in her hair and bosom, shipped with her dear Captain for the\\nlong cruise which had its storms and calms, but never any shipwreck\\nof the love that grew and blossomed with the water-lilies by the\\nsea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOPPIES AND WHEAT\\n\\n\\nAS the great steamer swung round into the stream the cloud of white\\nhandkerchiefs waving on the wharf melted away, the last good-byes\\ngrew fainter, and those who went and those who stayed felt that the\\nparting was over,--\\n\\n“It may be for years, and it may be forever,”\\n\\nas the song says.\\n\\nWith only one of the many groups on the deck need we concern\\nourselves, and a few words will introduce our fellow-travellers. A\\nbrisk middle-aged lady leaned on the arm of a middle-aged gentleman\\nin spectacles, both wearing the calmly cheerful air of people used\\nto such scenes, and conscious only of the relief change of place\\nbrings to active minds and busy lives.\\n\\nBefore them stood two girls, evidently their charges, and as\\nevidently not sisters, for in all respects they were a great\\ncontrast. The younger was a gay creature of seventeen, in an\\neffective costume of navy-blue and white, with bright hair blowing\\nin the wind, sparkling eyes roving everywhere, lively tongue going,\\nand an air of girlish excitement pleasant to see. Both hands were\\nfull of farewell bouquets, which she surveyed with more pride than\\ntenderness as she glanced at another group of girls less blessed\\nwith floral offerings.\\n\\nHer companion was a small, quiet person, some years older than\\nherself, very simply dressed, laden with wraps, and apparently\\nconscious just then of nothing but three dark specks on the wharf,\\nas she still waved her little white flag, and looked shoreward with\\neyes too dim for seeing. A sweet, modest face it was, with\\nintelligent eyes, a firm mouth, and the look of one who had early\\nlearned self-reliance and self-control.\\n\\nThe lady and gentleman watched the pair with interest and amusement;\\nfor both liked young people, and were anxious to know these two\\nbetter, since they were to be their guides and guardians for six\\nmonths. Professor Homer was going abroad to look up certain\\nimportant facts for his great historical work, and as usual took his\\nwife with him; for they had no family, and the good lady was ready\\nto march to any quarter of the globe at short notice. Fearing to be\\nlonely while her husband pored over old papers in foreign libraries,\\nMrs. Homer had invited Ethel Amory, a friend’s daughter, to\\naccompany her. Of course the invitation was gladly accepted, for it\\nwas a rare opportunity to travel in such company, and Ethel was wild\\nwith delight at the idea. One thorn, however, vexed her, among\\nthe roses with which her way seemed strewn. Mamma would not let her\\ntake a French maid, but preferred a young lady as companion; for,\\nthree being an awkward number, a fourth party would be not only\\nconvenient, but necessary on the girl’s account, since she was not\\nused to take care of herself and Mrs. Homer could only be expected\\nto act as chaperone.\\n\\n“Jane Bassett is just the person I want, and Jane shall go. She\\nneeds a change after teaching all these years; it will do her a\\nworld of good, for she will improve and enjoy every moment, and the\\nsalary I shall offer her will make it worth her while,” said Mrs.\\nAmory, as she discussed the plan with her daughter.\\n\\n“She is only three years older than I am, and I hate to be taken\\ncare of, and watched, and fussed over. I can order a maid round, but\\na companion is worse than a governess; such people are always\\nsensitive and proud, and hard to get on with. Every one takes a\\nmaid, and I’d set my heart on that nice Marie who wants to go home,\\nand talks such lovely French. Do let me have her, Mamma!” begged\\nEthel, who was a spoiled child and usually got her own way.\\n\\nBut for once Mamma stood firm, having a strong desire to benefit her\\ndaughter by the society of better companions than the gay girls of\\nher own set, also to give a great pleasure to good little Jane\\nBassett, who had been governessing ever since she was sixteen, with\\nvery few vacations in her hard, dutiful life.\\n\\n“No, darling, I have asked Jane, and if her mother can spare her,\\nJane it shall be. She is just what you need,--sensible and kind,\\nintelligent and capable; not ashamed to do anything for you, and\\nable to teach you a great deal in a pleasant way. Mrs. Homer\\napproves of her, and I am sure you will be glad by-and-by; for\\ntravelling is not all ‘fun,’ as you expect, and I don’t want you to\\nbe a burden on our friends. You two young things can take care of\\neach other while the Professor and his wife are busy with their own\\naffairs; and Jane is a far better companion for you than that\\ncoquettish French woman, who will probably leave you in the lurch as\\nsoon as you reach Paris. I shouldn’t have a moment’s peace if you\\nwere left with her, but I have entire confidence in Jane Bassett\\nbecause she is faithful, discreet, and a true lady in all things.”\\n\\nThere was no more to be said, and Ethel pouted in vain. Jane\\naccepted the place with joy; and after a month of delightful hurry\\nthey were off, one all eagerness for the new world, the other full\\nof tender regret for the dear souls left behind. How they got on,\\nand what they learned, remains to be told.\\n\\n“Come, Miss Bassett, we can’t see them any longer, so we may as well\\nbegin to enjoy ourselves. You might take those things down below,\\nand settle the stateroom a bit; I’m going to walk about and get my\\nbearings before lunch. You will find me somewhere round.”\\n\\nEthel spoke with a little tone of command, having made up her mind\\nto be mistress and keep Jane Bassett in her place, though she did\\nknow three languages and sketched much better than Miss Amory.\\n\\nJenny, as we who are going to be her bosom friends will call her,\\nnodded cheerfully, and looked about for the stairway; for, never\\nhaving been on a steamer before, she was rather bewildered.\\n\\n“I’ll show you the way, my dear. I always get my things settled at\\nonce, as one never knows when one may have to turn in. The Professor\\nwill go with you, Ethel; it is not proper for you to roam about\\nalone;” and with that hint Mrs. Homer led the way below, privately\\nwondering how these young persons were going to get on together.\\n\\nJane swallowed her “heimweh” in silence, and bestirred herself so\\nwell that soon the stateroom looked very cosy with the wrappers laid\\nready, the hanging bags tacked up, and all made ship-shape for the\\nten days’ trip.\\n\\n“But where are YOUR comforts? You have given Ethel all the room, the\\nlower berth, and the best of everything,” said Mrs. Homer, popping\\nin her head to see how her quiet neighbor got on.\\n\\n“Oh, I live in my trunk; I didn’t bring half as many little luxuries\\nas Ethel did, so I don’t need as much room. I’m used to living in\\ncorners like a mouse, and I get on very well,” answered Jane,\\nlooking very like a mouse just then, as she peeped out of the upper\\nberth, with her gray gown, bright eyes, and quick nod of\\ncontentment.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, I’ve just one word of advice to give you. Don’t let\\nthat child tyrannize over you. She means well, but is wilful and\\nthoughtless, and it is NOT your duty to be made a slave of. Assert\\nyourself and she will obey and respect you, and you will help her a\\ngreat deal. I know all about it; I was a companion in my youth, and\\nhad a hard time of it till I revolted and took my proper place. Now\\nlet us go up and enjoy the fine air while we can.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will remember;” and Jane offered the good lady her\\narm, with a feeling of gratitude for such friendliness, all being\\nnew and strange to her, and many doubts of her own fitness for the\\nposition lying heavy at her heart.\\n\\nBut soon all was forgotten as she sat on deck watching the islands,\\nlighthouses, ships, and shores glide by as she went swiftly out to\\nsea that bright June day. Here was the long-cherished desire of her\\nlife come to pass at last, and now the parting with mother and\\nsisters was over, nothing but pleasure remained, and a very earnest\\npurpose to improve this unexpected opportunity to the uttermost.\\nThe cares of life had begun early for little Jane, she being the\\neldest of the three girls, and her mother a widow. First came hard\\nstudy, then a timid beginning as nursery governess; and as year by\\nyear the teaching of others taught her, she ventured on till here\\nshe was companion to a fine young lady “going abroad,” where every\\nfacility for acquiring languages, studying history, seeing the best\\npictures, and enjoying good society would all be hers. No wonder the\\nquiet face under the modest gray hat beamed, as it turned wistfully\\ntoward the unknown world before her, and that her thoughts were so\\nfar away, she was quite unconscious of the kind eyes watching her,\\nas Mrs. Homer sat placidly knitting beside her.\\n\\n“I shall like the Mouse, I’m quite sure. Hope Lemuel will be as well\\nsatisfied. Ethel is charming when she chooses, but will need looking\\nafter, that’s plain,” thought the lady as she glanced down the deck\\nto where her husband stood talking with several gentlemen, while his\\ncharge was already making friends with the gay girls who were to be\\nher fellow-passengers.\\n\\n“Daisy Millers, I fear,” went on Mrs. Homer, who had a keen eye for\\ncharacter, and was as fond of studying the people about her as the\\nProfessor was of looking up dead statesmen, kings, and warriors. The\\nyoung ladies certainly bore some resemblance to the type of American\\ngirl which one never fails to meet in travelling. They were dressed\\nin the height of the fashion, pretty with the delicate evanescent\\nbeauty of too many of our girls, and all gifted with the loud\\nvoices, shrill laughter, and free-and-easy manners which so astonish\\ndecorous English matrons and maids. Ethel was evidently impressed\\nwith their style, as they had a man and maid at their beck and call,\\nand every sign of ostentatious wealth about them. A stout papa, a\\nthin mamma, evidently worn out with the cares of the past winter,\\nthree half-grown girls, and a lad of sixteen made up the party; and\\na very lively one it was, as the Professor soon found, for he\\npresently bowed himself away, and left Ethel to her new friends,\\nsince she smilingly refused to leave them.\\n\\n“Ought I to go to her?” asked Jenny, waking from her happy reverie\\nto a sudden sense of duty as the gentleman sat down beside her.\\n\\n“Oh dear, no, she is all right. Those are the Sibleys of New York.\\nHer father knows them, and she will find them a congenial refuge\\nwhen she tires of us quiet folk; and you too, perhaps?” added the\\nProfessor as he glanced at the girl.\\n\\n“I think not. I should not be welcome to them, nor are they the sort\\nof people I like. I shall be very happy with the ‘quiet folk,’ if\\nthey won’t let me be in the way,” answered Jenny, in the cheerful\\nvoice that reminded one of the chirp of a robin.\\n\\n“We won’t; we’ll toss you overboard as soon as you begin to scream\\nand bounce in that style,” he answered, laughing at the idea of this\\ndemure young person’s ever dreaming of such a thing. Jenny laughed\\nalso, and ran to pick up Mrs. Homer’s ball, as it set out for a roll\\ninto the lee-scuppers. As she brought it back she found the\\nProfessor examining the book she left behind her.\\n\\n“Like all young travellers you cling to your ‘Baedeker,’ I see, even\\nin the first excitement of the start. He is a useful fellow, but I\\nknow my Europe so well now, I don’t need him.”\\n\\n“I thought it would be wise to read up our route a little, then I\\nneedn’t ask questions. They must be very tiresome to people who know\\nall about it,” said Jenny, regarding him with an expression of deep\\nrespect for she considered him a sort of walking encyclopaedia of\\nuniversal knowledge.\\n\\nIt pleased the learned man, who was kindly as well as wise, and\\nloved to let his knowledge overflow into any thirsty mind, however\\nsmall the cup might be. He liked the intelligent face before him,\\nand a timid question or two set him off on his favorite hobby at a\\npleasant amble, with Jenny on the pillion behind, as it were. She\\nenjoyed it immensely, and was deep in French history, when the lunch\\ngong recalled her from Francis I. and his sister Margaret to chops\\nand English ale.\\n\\nEthel came prancing back to her own party, full of praises of the\\nSibleys, and the fun they meant to have together.\\n\\n“They are going to the Langham; so we shall be able to go about with\\nthem, and they know all the best shops, and some lords and ladies,\\nand expect to be in Paris when we are, and that will be a great help\\nwith our dresses and things.”\\n\\n“But we are not going to shop and have new dresses till we are on\\nour way home, you know. Now we haven’t time for such things, and\\ncan’t trouble the Homers with more trunks,” answered Jenny, as they\\nfollowed their elders to the table.\\n\\n“I shall buy what I like, and have ten trunks if it suits me. I’m\\nnot going to poke round over old books and ruins, and live in a\\ntravelling-dress all the time. You can do as you like; it’s\\ndifferent with me, and _I_ know what is proper.”\\n\\nWith which naughty speech Ethel took her seat first at the table,\\nand began to nod and smile at the Sibleys opposite. Jenny set her\\nlips and made no answer, but ate her lunch with what appetite she\\ncould, trying to forget her troubles in listening to the chat going\\non around her.\\n\\nAll that afternoon Ethel left her to herself, and enjoyed the more\\ncongenial society of the new acquaintances. Jenny was tired, and\\nglad to read and dream in the comfortable seat Mrs. Homer left her\\nwhen she went for her nap.\\n\\nBy sunset the sea grew rough and people began to vanish below. There\\nwere many empty places at dinner-time, and those who appeared seemed\\nto have lost their appetites suddenly. The Homers were good\\nsailors, but Jenny looked pale, and Ethel said her head ached,\\nthough both kept up bravely till nine o’clock, when the Sibleys\\nprecipitately retired after supper, and Ethel thought she might as\\nwell go to bed early to be ready for another pleasant day to-morrow.\\n\\nJenny had a bad night, but disturbed no one. Ethel slept soundly,\\nand sprang up in the morning, eager to be the first on deck. But a\\nsudden lurch sent her and her hair-brush into a corner: and when she\\nrose, everything in the stateroom seemed to be turning somersaults,\\nwhile a deathly faintness crept over her.\\n\\n“Oh, wake up, Jane! We are sinking! What is it? Help me, help me!”\\n and with a dismal wail Ethel tumbled into her berth in the first\\nanguish of seasickness.\\n\\nWe will draw the curtain for three days, during which rough weather\\nand general despair reigned. Mrs. Homer took care of the girls till\\nJenny was able to sit up and amuse Ethel; but the latter had a hard\\ntime of it, for a series of farewell lunches had left her in a bad\\nstate for a sea-voyage, and the poor girl could not lift her head\\nfor days. The new-made friends did not trouble themselves about her\\nafter a call of condolence, but faithful Jenny sat by her hour after\\nhour, reading and talking by day, singing her to sleep at night, and\\noften creeping from her bed on the sofa to light her little candle\\nand see that her charge was warmly covered and quite comfortable.\\nEthel was used to being petted, so she was not very grateful; but\\nshe felt the watchful care about her, and thought Jane almost as\\nhandy a person as a maid, and told her so.\\n\\nJenny thanked her and said nothing of her own discomforts; but Mrs.\\nHomer saw them, and wrote to Mrs. Amory that so far the companion\\nwas doing admirably and all that could be desired. A few days later\\nshe added more commendations to the journal-letters she kept for the\\nanxious mothers at home, and this serio-comical event was the cause\\nof her fresh praises.\\n\\nThe occupants of the deck staterooms were wakened in the middle of\\nthe night by a crash and a cry, and starting up found that the\\nengines were still, and something was evidently the matter\\nsomewhere. A momentary panic took place; ladies screamed, children\\ncried, and gentlemen in queer costumes burst out of their rooms,\\nexcitedly demanding, “What is the matter?”\\n\\nAs no lamps are allowed in the rooms at night, darkness added to the\\nalarm, and it was some time before the real state of the case was\\nknown. Mrs. Homer went at once to the frightened girls, and found\\nEthel clinging to Jenny, who was trying to find the life-preservers\\nlashed to the wall.\\n\\n“We’ve struck! Don’t leave me! Let us die together! Oh, why did I\\ncome? why did I come?” she wailed; while the other girl answered\\nwith a brave attempt at cheerfulness, as she put over Ethel’s head\\nthe only life-preserver she could find,--.\\n\\n“I will! I will! Be calm, dear! I guess there is no immediate\\ndanger. Hold fast to this while I try to find something warm for you\\nto put on.”\\n\\nIn a moment Jenny’s candle shone like a star of hope in the gloom,\\nand by the time the three had got into wrappers and shawls, a peal\\nof laughter from the Professor assured them that the danger could\\nnot be great. Other sounds of merriment, as well as Mrs. Sibley’s\\nvoice scolding violently, was heard; and presently Mr. Homer came to\\ntell them to be calm, for the stoppage was only to cool the engines,\\nand the noise was occasioned by Joe Sibley’s tumbling out of his\\nberth in a fit of nightmare caused by Welsh rarebits and poached\\neggs at eleven at night.\\n\\nMuch relieved, and a little ashamed now of their fright, every one\\nsubsided; but Ethel could not sleep, and clung to Jenny in an\\nhysterical state till a soft voice began to sing “Abide with me” so\\nsweetly that more than one agitated listener blessed the singer and\\nfell asleep before the comforting hymn ended.\\n\\nEthel was up next day, and lay on the Professor’s bearskin rug on\\ndeck, looking pale and interesting, while the Sibleys sat by her\\ntalking over the exciting event of the night, to poor Joe’s great\\ndisgust. Jenny crept to her usual corner and sat with a book on her\\nlap, quietly reviving in the fresh air till she was able to enjoy\\nthe pleasant chat of the Homers, who established themselves near by\\nand took care of her, learning each day to love and respect the\\nfaithful little soul who kept her worries to herself, and looked\\nbrightly forward no matter how black the sky might be.\\n\\nOnly one other incident of the voyage need be told; but as that\\nmarked a change in the relations between the two girls it is worth\\nrecording.\\n\\nAs she prepared for bed late one evening, Mrs. Homer heard Jenny say\\nin a tone never used before,--\\n\\n“My dear, I must say something to you or I shall not feel as if I\\nwere doing my duty. I promised your mother that you should keep\\nearly hours, as you are not very strong and excitement is bad for\\nyou. Now, you WON’T come to bed at ten, as I ask you to every night,\\nbut stay up playing cards or sitting on deck till nearly every one\\nbut the Sibleys is gone. Mrs. Homer waits for us, and is tired, and\\nit is very rude to keep her up. Will you PLEASE do as you ought, and\\nnot oblige me to say you must?”\\n\\nEthel was sleepy and cross, and answered pettishly, as she held out\\nher foot to have her boot unbuttoned,--for Jenny, anxious to please,\\nrefused no service asked of her,--\\n\\n“I shall do as I like, and you and Mrs. Homer needn’t trouble\\nyourselves about me. Mamma wished me to have a good time, and I\\nshall! There is no harm in staying up to enjoy the moonlight, and\\nsing and tell stories. Mrs. Sibley knows what is proper better than\\nyou do.”\\n\\n“I don’t think she does, for she goes to bed and leaves the girls to\\nflirt with those officers in a way that I know is NOT proper,”\\n answered Jenny, firmly. “I should be very sorry to hear them say of\\nyou as they did of the Sibley girls, ‘They are a wild lot, but great\\nfun.’”\\n\\n“Did they say that? How impertinent!” and Ethel bridled up like a\\nruffled chicken, for she was not out yet, and had not lost the\\nmodest instincts that so soon get blunted when a frivolous\\nfashionable life begins.\\n\\n“I heard them, and I know that the well-bred people on board do not\\nlike the Sibleys’ noisy ways and bad manners. Now, you, my dear, are\\nyoung and unused to this sort of life; so you cannot be too careful\\nwhat you say and do, and with whom you go.”\\n\\n“Good gracious! any one would think YOU were as wise as Solomon and\\nas old as the hills. YOU are young, and YOU haven’t travelled, and\\ndon’t know any more of the world than I do,--not so much of some\\nthings; so you needn’t preach.”\\n\\n“I’m not wise nor old, but I DO know more of the world than you, for\\nI began to take care of myself and earn my living at sixteen, and\\nfour years of hard work have taught me a great deal. I am to watch\\nover you, and I intend to do it faithfully, no matter what you say,\\nnor how hard you make it for me; because I promised, and I shall\\nkeep my word. We are not to trouble Mrs. Homer with our little\\nworries, but try to help each other and have a really good time. I\\nwill do anything for you that I can, but I shall NOT let you do\\nthings which I wouldn’t allow my own sisters to do, and if you\\nrefuse to mind me, I shall write to your mother and ask to go home.\\nMy conscience won’t let me take money and pleasure unless I earn\\nthem and do my duty.”\\n\\n“Well, upon my word!” cried Ethel, much impressed by such a decided\\nspeech from gentle Jane, and dismayed at the idea of being taken\\nhome in disgrace.\\n\\n“We won’t talk any more now, because we may get angry and say what\\nwe should be sorry for. I am sure you will see that I am right when\\nyou think it over quietly. So good-night, dear.”\\n\\n“Good-night,” was all the reply Ethel gave, and a long silence\\nfollowed.\\n\\nMrs. Homer could not help hearing as the staterooms were close\\ntogether, and the well-ventilated doors made all conversation\\nbeyond a whisper audible.\\n\\n“I didn’t think Jane had the spirit to talk like that. She has taken\\nmy hint and asserted herself, and I’m very glad, for Ethel must be\\nset right at once or we shall have no peace. She will respect and\\nobey Jane after this, or I shall be obliged to say MY word.”\\n\\nMrs. Homer was right, and before her first nap set in she heard a\\nmeek voice say,--\\n\\n“Are you asleep, Miss Bassett?”\\n\\n“No, dear.”\\n\\n“Then I want to say, I’ve thought it over. Please DON’T write to\\nmamma. I’ll be good. I’m sorry I was rude to you; do forgive--”\\n\\nThe sentence was not ended, for a sudden rustle, a little sob, and\\nseveral hearty kisses plainly told that Jenny had flown to pardon,\\ncomfort, and caress her naughty child, and that all was well.\\n\\nAfter that Ethel’s behavior was painfully decorous for the rest of\\nthe voyage, which, fortunately for her good resolutions, ended at\\nQueenstown, much to her regret. The Homers thought a glimpse at\\nIreland and Scotland would be good for the girls; and as the\\nProfessor had business in Edinburgh this was the better route for\\nall parties. But Ethel longed for London, and refused to see any\\nbeauty in the Lakes of Killarney, turned up her nose at\\njaunting-cars, and pronounced Dublin a stupid place.\\n\\nScotland suited her better, and she could not help enjoying the fine\\nscenery with such companions as the Homers; for the Professor knew\\nall about the relics and ruins, and his wife had a memory richly\\nstored with the legends, poetry, and romance which make dull facts\\nmemorable and history enchanting.\\n\\nBut Jenny’s quiet rapture was pleasant to behold. She had not\\nscorned Scott’s novels as old-fashioned, and she peopled the\\ncottages and castles with his heroes and heroines; she crooned\\nBurns’s sweet songs to herself as she visited his haunts, and went\\nabout in a happy sort of dream, with her head full of Highland Mary,\\nTam o’ Shanter, field-mice and daisies, or fought terrific battles\\nwith Fitz-James and Marmion, and tried if “the light harebell” would\\n“raise its head, elastic from her airy tread,” as it did from the\\nLady of the Lake’s famous foot.\\n\\nEthel told her she was “clean daft;” but Jenny said, “Let me enjoy\\nit while I can. I’ve dreamed of it so long I can hardly realize that\\nit has come, and I cannot lose a minute of it;” so she absorbed\\nScotch poetry and romance with the mist and the keen air from the\\nmoors, and bloomed like the bonnie heather which she loved to wear.\\n\\n“What shall we do this rainy day in this stupid place?” said Ethel,\\none morning when bad weather kept them from an excursion to Stirling\\nCastle.\\n\\n“Write our journals and read up for the visit; then we shall know\\nall about the castle, and need not tire people with our questions,”\\n answered Jenny, already established in a deep window-seat of their\\nparlor at the hotel with her books and portfolio.\\n\\n“I don’t keep a journal, and I hate to read guide-books; it’s much\\neasier to ask, though there is very little I care for about these\\nmouldy old places,” said Ethel with a yawn, as she looked out into\\nthe muddy street.\\n\\n“How can you say so? Don’t you care for poor Mary, and Prince\\nCharlie, and all the other sad and romantic memories that haunt the\\ncountry? Why, it seems as real to me as if it happened yesterday,\\nand I never can forget anything about the place or the people now.\\nReally, dear, I think you ought to take more interest and improve\\nthis fine chance. Just see how helpful and lovely Mrs. Homer is,\\nwith a quotation for every famous spot we see. It adds so much to\\nour pleasure, and makes her so interesting. I’m going to learn some\\nof the fine bits in this book of hers, and make them my own, since I\\ncannot buy the beautiful little set this Burns belongs to. Don’t you\\nwant to try it, and while away the dull day by hearing each other\\nrecite and talking over the beautiful places we have seen?”\\n\\n“No, thank you; no study for me. It is to be all play now. Why tire\\nmy wits with that Scotch stuff when Mrs. Homer is here to do it for\\nme?” and lazy Ethel turned to the papers on the table for amusement\\nmore to her taste.\\n\\n“But we shouldn’t think only of our own pleasure, you know. It is so\\nsweet to be able to teach, amuse, or help others in any way. I’m\\nglad to learn this new accomplishment, so that I may be to some one\\nby-and-by what dear Mrs. Homer is to us now, if I ever can. Didn’t\\nyou see how charmed those English people were at Holyrood when she\\nwas reciting those fine lines to us? The old gentleman bowed and\\nthanked her, and the handsome lady called her ‘a book of elegant\\nextracts.’ I thought it was such a pretty and pleasant thing that I\\ndescribed it all to mother and the girls.”\\n\\n“So it was; but did you know that the party was Lord Cumberland and\\nhis family? The guide told me afterward. I never guessed they were\\nanybody, in such plain tweed gowns and thick boots; did you?”\\n\\n“I knew they were ladies and gentlemen by their manners and\\nconversation; did you expect they would travel in coronets and\\nermine mantles?” laughed Jenny.\\n\\n“I’m not such a goose! But I’m glad we met them, because I can tell\\nthe Sibleys of it. They think so much of titles, and brag about Lady\\nWatts Barclay, whose husband is only a brewer knighted. I shall buy\\na plaid like the one the lord’s daughter wore, and wave it in the\\nfaces of those girls; they do put on SUCH airs because they have\\nbeen in Europe before.”\\n\\nJenny was soon absorbed in her books; so Ethel curled herself up in\\nthe window-seat with an illustrated London paper full of some royal\\nevent, and silence reigned for an hour. Neither had seen the\\nProfessor’s glasses rise like two full moons above his paper now and\\nthen to peep at them as they chatted at the other end of the room;\\nneither saw him smile as he made a memorandum in his note-book, nor\\nguessed how pleased he was at Jenny’s girlish admiration of his\\nplain but accomplished and excellent wife. It was one of the trifles\\nwhich went to form his opinion of the two lasses, and in time to\\nsuggest a plan which ended in great joy for one of them.\\n\\n“Now the real fun begins, and I shall be perfectly contented,” cried\\nEthel as they rolled through the London streets towards the dingy\\nLangham Hotel, where Americans love to congregate.\\n\\nJenny’s eyes were sparkling also, and she looked as if quite ready\\nfor the new scenes and excitements which the famous old city\\npromised them, though she had private doubts as to whether anything\\ncould be more delightful than Scotland.\\n\\nThe Sibleys were at the hotel; and the ladies of both parties at\\nonce began a round of shopping and sightseeing, while the gentlemen\\nwent about their more important affairs. Joe was detailed for escort\\nduty; and a fine time the poor lad had of it, trailing about with\\nseven ladies by day and packing them into two cabs at night for the\\ntheatres and concerts they insisted on trying to enjoy in spite of\\nheat and weariness.\\n\\nMrs. Homer and Jenny were soon tired of this “whirl of gayety,” as\\nthey called it, and planned more quiet excursions with some hours\\neach day for rest and the writing and reading which all wise\\ntourists make a part of their duty and pleasure. Ethel rebelled, and\\nmuch preferred the “rabble,” as Joe irreverently called his troop of\\nladies, never losing her delight in Regent Street shops, the parks\\nat the fashionable hour, and the evening shows in full blast\\neverywhere during the season. She left the sober party whenever she\\ncould escape, and with Mrs. Sibley as chaperone, frolicked about\\nwith the gay girls to her heart’s content. It troubled Jenny, and\\nmade her feel as if she were not doing her duty; but Mrs. Homer\\nconsoled her by the fact that a month was all they could give to\\nLondon, and soon the parties would separate, for the Sibleys were\\nbound for Paris, and the Professor for Switzerland and Germany,\\nthrough August and September.\\n\\nSo little Jane gave herself up to the pleasures she loved, and with\\nthe new friends, whose kindness she tried to repay by every small\\nservice in her power, spent happy days among the famous haunts they\\nknew so well, learning much and storing away all she saw and heard\\nfor future profit and pleasure. A few samples of the different ways\\nin which our young travellers improved their opportunities will\\nsufficiently illustrate this new version of the gay grasshopper and\\nthe thrifty ant.\\n\\nWhen they visited Westminster Abbey, Ethel was soon tired of tombs\\nand chapels, and declared that the startling tableau of the skeleton\\nDeath peeping out of the half-opened door of the tomb to throw his\\ndart at Mrs. Nightingale, and the ludicrous has-relief of some great\\nearl in full peer’s robes and coronet being borne to heaven in the\\narms of fat cherubs puffing under their load, were the only things\\nworth seeing.\\n\\nJenny sat spellbound in the Poets’ Corner, listening while Mrs.\\nHomer named the illustrious dead around them; followed the verger\\nfrom chapel to chapel with intelligent interest as he told the story\\nof each historical or royal tomb, and gave up Madam Tussaud’s\\nwax-work to spend several happy hours sketching the beautiful\\ncloisters in the Abbey to add to her collection of water-colors,\\ntaken as she went from place to place, to serve as studies for her\\npupils at home.\\n\\nAt the Tower she grew much excited over the tragic spots she visited\\nand the heroic tales she heard of the kings and queens, the noble\\nhearts and wise heads, that pined and perished there. Ethel “hated\\nhorrors,” she said, and cared only for the crown jewels, the faded\\neffigies in the armor gallery, and the queer Highlanders skirling on\\nthe bagpipes in the courtyard.\\n\\nAt Kew Jenny revelled in the rare flowers, and was stricken with\\namazement at the Victoria Regia, the royal water-lily, so large that\\na child could sit on one of its vast leaves as on a green island.\\nHer interest and delight so touched the heart of the crusty keeper\\nthat he gave her a nosegay of orchids, which excited the envy of\\nEthel and the Sibley girls, who were of the party, but had soon\\nwearied of plants and gone off to order tea in Flora’s Bower,--one\\nof the little cottages where visitors repose and refresh themselves\\nwith weak tea and Bath buns in such tiny rooms that they have to put\\ntheir wraps in the fireplace or out of the window while they feast.\\n\\nAt the few parties to which they went,--for the Homers’ friends were\\nof the grave, elderly sort,--Jenny sat in a corner taking notes of\\nthe gay scene, while Ethel yawned. But the Mouse got many a crumb of\\ngood conversation as she nestled close to Mrs. Homer, drinking in\\nthe wise and witty chat that went on between the friends who came to\\npay their respects to the Professor and his interesting wife. Each\\nnight Jenny had new and famous names to add to the list in her\\njournal, and the artless pages were rich in anecdotes, descriptions,\\nand comments on the day’s adventures.\\n\\nBut the gem of her London collection of experiences was found in a\\nmost unexpected way, and not only gave her great pleasure, but made\\nthe young gadabouts regard her with sudden respect as one come to\\nhonor.\\n\\n“Let me stay and wait upon you; I’d much rather than go to the\\nCrystal Palace, for I shouldn’t enjoy it at all with you lying here\\nin pain and alone,” said Jenny one lovely morning when the girls\\ncame down ready for the promised excursion, to find Mrs. Homer laid\\nup with a nervous headache.\\n\\n“No, dear, you can do nothing for me, thanks. Quiet is all I need,\\nand my only worry is that I am not able to write up my husband’s\\nnotes for him. I promised to have them ready last night, but was so\\ntired I could not do it,” answered Mrs. Homer, as Jenny leaned over\\nher full of affectionate anxiety.\\n\\n“Let me do them! I’d be so proud to help; and I can, for I did copy\\nsome one day, and he said it was well done. Please let me; I should\\nenjoy a quiet morning here much better than the noisy party we shall\\nhave, since the Sibleys are to go.”\\n\\nWith some reluctance the invalid consented; and when the rest were\\ngone with hasty regrets, Jenny fell to work so briskly that in an\\nhour or two the task was done. She was looking wistfully out of the\\nwindow wondering where she could go alone, since Mrs. Homer was\\nasleep and no one needed her, when the Professor came in to see how\\nhis wife was before he went to the British Museum to consult certain\\nfamous books and parchments.\\n\\nHe was much pleased to find his notes in order, and after a glance\\nat the sleeping lady, told Jenny she was to come with him for a\\nvisit to a place which SHE would enjoy, though most young people\\nthought it rather dull.\\n\\nAway they went; and being given in charge to a pleasant old man,\\nJenny roamed over the vast Museum where the wonders of the world are\\ncollected, enjoying every moment, till Mr. Homer called her away, as\\nhis day’s work was done. It was late now, but she never thought of\\ntime, and came smiling up from the Egyptian Hall ready for the lunch\\nthe Professor proposed. They were just going out when a gentleman\\nmet them, and recognizing the American stopped to greet him\\ncordially. Jenny’s heart beat when she was presented to Mr.\\nGladstone, and she listened with all her ears to the silvery\\nun-English voice, and stared with all her eyes at the weary yet wise\\nand friendly face of the famous man.\\n\\n“I’m so glad! I wanted to see him very much, and I feel so grand to\\nthink I’ve really had a bow and a smile all to myself from the\\nPremier of England,” said Jenny in a flutter of girlish delight when\\nthe brief interview was over.\\n\\n“You shall go to the House of Commons with me and hear him speak\\nsome day; then your cup will be full, since you have already seen\\nBrowning, heard Irving, taken tea with Jean Ingelow, and caught a\\nglimpse of the royal family,” said the Professor, enjoying her keen\\ninterest in people and places.\\n\\n“Oh, thanks! that will be splendid. I do love to see famous persons,\\nbecause it gives me a true picture of them, and adds to my desire to\\nknow more of them, and admire their virtues or shun their faults.”\\n\\n“Yes, that sort of mental picture-gallery is a good thing to have,\\nand we will add as many fine portraits as we can. Now you shall ride\\nin a Hansom, and see how you like that.”\\n\\nJenny was glad to do so, for ladies do not use these vehicles when\\nalone, and Ethel had put on great airs after a spin in one with Joe.\\nJenny was girl enough to like to have her little adventures to boast\\nof, and that day she was to have another which eclipsed all that her\\nyoung companions ever knew.\\n\\nA brisk drive, a cosy lunch at a famous chop-house where Johnson\\nhad drunk oceans of tea, was followed by a stroll in the Park; for\\nthe Professor liked his young comrade, and was grateful for the\\nwell-written notes which helped on his work.\\n\\nAs they leaned against the railing to watch the splendid equipages\\nroll by, one that seemed well known, though only conspicuous by its\\nquiet elegance, stopped near them, and the elder of the two ladies\\nin it bowed and beckoned to Professor Homer. He hastened forward to\\nbe kindly greeted and invited to drive along the Ladies’ Mile.\\nJenny’s breath was nearly taken away when she was presented to the\\nDuchess of S--, and found herself sitting in a luxurious carriage\\nopposite her Grace and her companion, with a white-wigged coachman\\nperched aloft and two powdered footmen erect behind. Secretly\\nrejoicing that she had made herself especially nice for her trip\\nwith the Professor, and remembering that young English girls are\\nexpected to efface themselves in the company of their elders, she\\nsat mute and modest, stealing shy glances from under her hat-brim at\\nthe great lady, who was talking in the simplest way with her guest\\nabout his work, in which, as a member of one of the historical\\nhouses of England, she took much interest. A few gracious words fell\\nto Jenny’s share before they were set down at the door of the hotel,\\nto the great admiration of the porter, who recognized the liveries\\nand spread the news.\\n\\n“This is a good sample of the way things go in Vanity Fair. We\\ntrudge away to our daily work afoot, we treat ourselves to a humble\\ncab through the mud, pause in the park to watch the rich and great,\\nget whisked into a ducal carriage, and come home in state, feeling\\nrather exalted, don’t we?” asked the Professor as they went\\nupstairs, and he observed the new air of dignity which Jane\\nunconsciously assumed as an obsequious waiter flew before to open\\nthe door.\\n\\n“I think we do,” answered honest Jane, laughing as she caught the\\ntwinkle of his eyes behind the spectacles. “I like splendor, and I\\nAM rather set up to think I’ve spoken to a live duchess; but I think\\nI like her beautiful old face and charming manners more than her\\nfine coach or great name. Why, she was much more simply dressed than\\nMrs. Sibley, and talked as pleasantly as if she did not feel a bit\\nabove us. Yet one couldn’t forget that she was noble, and lived in a\\nvery different world from ours.”\\n\\n“That is just it, my dear; she IS a noble woman in every sense of\\nthe word, and has a right to her title. Her ancestors were\\nkingmakers, and she is Lady-in-waiting to the Queen; yet she leads\\nthe charities of London, and is the friend of all who help the world\\nalong. I’m glad you have met her, and seen so good a sample of a\\ntrue aristocrat. We Americans affect to scorn titles, but too many\\nof us hanker for them in secret, and bow before very poor imitations\\nof the real thing. Don’t fill your journal with fine names, as some\\nmuch wiser folk do, but set down only the best, and remember, ‘All\\nthat glitters is not gold.’”\\n\\n“I will, sir.” And Jenny put away the little sermon side by side\\nwith the little adventure, saying nothing of either till Mrs. Homer\\nspoke of it, having heard the story from her husband.\\n\\n“How I wish I’d been there, instead of fagging round that great\\npalace full of rubbish! A real Duchess! Won’t the Sibleys stare? We\\nshall hear no more of Lady Watts Barclay after this, I guess, and\\nyou will be treated with great respect; see if you are not!” said\\nEthel, much impressed with her companion’s good fortune and eager to\\ntell it.\\n\\n“If things of that sort affect them, their respect is not worth\\nhaving,” answered Jane, quietly accepting the arm Ethel offered her\\nas they went to dinner,--a very unusual courtesy, the cause of which\\nshe understood and smiled at.\\n\\nEthel looked as if she felt the reproof, but said nothing, only set\\nan example of greater civility to her companion, which the other\\ngirls involuntarily followed, after they had heard of Jenny’s\\nexcursion with the Professor.\\n\\nThe change was very grateful to patient Jane, who had borne many\\nsmall slights in proud silence; but it was soon over, for the\\nparties separated, and our friends left the city far behind them, as\\nthey crossed the channel, and sailed up the Rhine to Schwalbach,\\nwhere Mrs. Homer was to try the steel springs for her rheumatism\\nwhile the Professor rested after his London labors.\\n\\nA charming journey, and several very happy weeks followed as the\\ngirls roamed about the Little Brunnen, gay with people from all\\nparts of Europe, come to try the famous mineral waters, and rest\\nunder the lindens.\\n\\nJenny found plenty to sketch here, and was busy all day booking\\npicturesque groups as they sat in the Allee Saal, doing pretty\\nwoodland bits as they strolled among the hills, carefully copying\\nthe arches and statues in St. Elizabeth’s Chapel, or the queer old\\nhouses in the Jews’ Quarter of the town. Even the pigs went into the\\nportfolio, with the little swineherd blowing his horn in the morning\\nto summon each lazy porker from its sty to join the troop that\\ntrotted away to eat acorns in the oak wood on the hill till sunset\\ncalled them home again.\\n\\nEthel’s chief amusement was buying trinkets at the booths near the\\nStahlbrunnen. A tempting display of pretty crystal, agate, and steel\\njewelry was there, with French bonbons, Swiss carvings, German\\nembroidery and lace-work, and most delectable little portfolios of\\nviews of fine scenery or illustrations of famous books. Ethel spent\\nmuch money here, and added so greatly to her store of souvenirs that\\na new trunk was needed to hold the brittle treasures she accumulated\\nin spite of the advice given her to wait till she reached Paris,\\nwhere all could be bought much cheaper and packed safely for\\ntransportation.\\n\\nJenny contented herself with a German book, Kaulbach’s Goethe\\nGallery, and a set of ornaments for each sister; the purple, pink,\\nand white crystals being cheap and pretty trinkets for young girls.\\nShe felt very rich with her generous salary to draw upon when she\\nliked; but having made a list of proper gifts, she resisted\\ntemptation and saved her money, remembering how much every penny was\\nneeded at home.\\n\\nDriving from the ruins of Hohenstein one lovely afternoon, the girls\\ngot out to walk up a long hill, and amused themselves gathering\\nflowers by the way. When they took their places again, Ethel had a\\ngreat bouquet of scarlet poppies, Jenny a nosegay of blue\\ncorn-flowers for Mrs. Homer, and a handful of green wheat for\\nherself.\\n\\n“You look as if you had been gleaning,” said the Professor, as he\\nwatched the girls begin to trim their rough straw hats with the gay\\ncoquelicots and the bearded ears.\\n\\n“I feel as if I were doing that every day, sir, and gathering in a\\ngreat harvest of pleasure, if nothing else,” answered Jenny, turning\\nher bright eyes full of gratitude from one kind face to the other.\\n\\n“My poppies are much prettier than that stiff stuff. Why didn’t you\\nget some?” asked Ethel, surveying her brilliant decoration with\\ngreat satisfaction.\\n\\n“They don’t last; but my wheat will, and only grow prettier as it\\nripens in my hat,” answered Jenny, contentedly settling the graceful\\nspires in the straw cord that bound the pointed crown.\\n\\n“Then the kernels will all drop out and leave the husks; that won’t\\nbe nice, I’m sure,” laughed Ethel.\\n\\n“Well, some hungry bird will pick them up and be glad of them. The\\nhusks will last a long time and remind me of this happy day; your\\npoppies are shedding their leaves already, and the odor is not\\npleasant. I like my honest breadmaking wheat better than your opium\\nflowers,” said Jenny, with her thoughtful smile, as she watched the\\nscarlet petals float away leaving the green seed-vessels bare.\\n\\n“Oh, I shall get some artificial ones at my little milliner’s, and\\nbe fine as long as I like; so you are welcome to your useful,\\nbristly old wheat,” said Ethel, rather nettled by the look that\\npassed between the elders.\\n\\nNothing more was said; but both girls remembered that little talk\\nlong afterward, for those two wayside nosegays served to point the\\nmoral of this little tale, if not to adorn it.\\n\\nWe have no space to tell all the pleasant wanderings of our\\ntravellers as they went from one interesting place to another, till\\nthey paused for a good rest at Geneva.\\n\\nHere Ethel quite lost her head among the glittering display of\\njewelry, and had to be watched lest she rashly spend her last penny.\\nThey were obliged almost forcibly to carry her out of the enchanting\\nshops; and no one felt safe till she was either on the lake, or\\ndriving to Chamouni, or asleep in her bed.\\n\\nJenny bought a watch, a very necessary thing for a teacher, and this\\nwas the best place to get a good one. It was chosen with care and\\nmuch serious consultation with the Professor; and Mrs. Homer added a\\nlittle chain and seal, finding Jenny about to content herself with a\\nblack cord.\\n\\n“It is only a return for many daughterly services, my dear; and my\\nhusband wishes me to offer these with thanks to the patient\\nsecretary who has often helped him so willingly,” she said, as she\\ncame to wake Jenny with a kiss on the morning of her twenty-first\\nbirthday.\\n\\nA set of little volumes like those she had admired was the second\\ngift, and Jenny was much touched to be so kindly remembered. Ethel\\ngave her some thread lace which she had longed to buy for her mother\\nat Brussels, but did not, finding it as costly as beautiful. It was\\na very happy day, though quietly spent sitting by the lake enjoying\\nthe well-chosen extracts from Shakspeare, Wordsworth, Byron, Burns,\\nScott, and other descriptive poets, and writing loving letters home,\\nproudly stamped with the little seal.\\n\\nAfter that, while Ethel haunted the brilliant shops, read novels in\\nthe hotel-garden, or listlessly followed the sight-seers, Jenny,\\nwith the help of her valuable little library, her industrious\\npencil, and her accomplished guides, laid up a store of precious\\nsouvenirs as they visited the celebrated spots that lie like a\\nnecklace of pearls around the lovely lake, with Mont Blanc as the\\nsplendid opal that fitly clasps the chain. Calvin and Geneva,\\nVoltaire and Ferney, De Stael and Coppet, Gibbon’s garden at\\nLausanne, Byron’s Prisoner at Chillon, Rousseau’s chestnut grove at\\nClarens, and all the legends, relics, and memories of Switzerland’s\\nheroes, romancers, poets, and philosophers, were carefully studied,\\nrecorded, and enjoyed; and when at last they steamed away toward\\nParis, Jenny felt as if her head and her heart and one little trunk\\nheld richer treasures than all the jewelry in Geneva.\\n\\nAt Lyons her second important purchase was made; for when they\\nvisited one of the great manufactories to execute several\\ncommissions given to Mrs. Homer, Jenny proudly bought a nice black\\nsilk for her mother. This, with the delicate lace, would make the\\ndear woman presentable for many a day, and the good girl beamed with\\nsatisfaction as she pictured the delight of all at home when this\\nsplendid gift appeared to adorn the dear parent-bird, who never\\ncared how shabby she was if her young were well feathered.\\n\\nIt was a trial to Jenny, when they reached Paris, to spend day after\\nday shopping, talking to dressmakers, and driving in the Bois to\\nwatch the elegant world on parade, when she longed to be living\\nthrough the French Revolution with Carlyle, copying the quaint\\nrelics at Hotel Cluny, or revelling in the treasures of the Louvre.\\n\\n“Why DO you want to study and poke all the time?” asked Ethel, as\\nthey followed Mrs. Homer and a French acquaintance round the Palais\\nRoyal one day with its brilliant shops, cafes, and crowds.\\n\\n“My dream is to be able to take a place as teacher of German and\\nhistory in a girl’s school next year. It is a fine chance, and I am\\npromised it if I am fitted; so I must work when I can to be ready.\\nThat is why I like Versailles better than Rue de Rivoli, and enjoy\\ntalking with Professor Homer about French kings and queens more than\\nI do buying mock diamonds and eating ices here,” answered Jenny,\\nlooking very tired of the glitter, noise, and dust of the gay place\\nwhen her heart was in the Conciergerie with poor Marie Antoinette,\\nor the Invalides, where lay the great Napoleon still guarded by his\\nfaithful Frenchmen.\\n\\n“What a dismal prospect! I should think you’d rather have a jolly\\ntime while you could, and trust to luck for a place by-and-by, if\\nyou must go on teaching,” said Ethel, stopping to admire a window\\nfull of distracting bonnets.\\n\\n“No; it is a charming prospect to me, for I love to teach, and I\\ncan’t leave anything to luck. God helps those who help themselves,\\nmother says, and I want to give the girls an easier time than I have\\nhad; so I shall get my tools ready, and fit myself to do good work\\nwhen the job comes to me,” answered Jenny, with such a decided air\\nthat the French lady glanced back at her, wondering if a quarrel was\\ngoing on between the demoiselles.\\n\\n“What do you mean by tools?” asked Ethel, turning from the gay\\nbonnets to a ravishing display of bonbons in the next window.\\n\\n“Professor Homer said one day that a well-stored mind was a\\ntool-chest with which one could carve one’s way. Now, my tools are\\nknowledge, memory, taste, the power of imparting what I know, good\\nmanners, sense, and--patience,” added Jenny, with a sigh, as she\\nthought of the weary years spent in teaching little children the\\nalphabet.\\n\\nEthel took the sigh to herself, well knowing that she had been a\\ntrial, especially of late, when she had insisted on Jane’s company\\nbecause her own French was so imperfect as to be nearly useless,\\nthough at home she had flattered herself that she knew a good deal.\\nHer own ignorance of many things had been unpleasantly impressed\\nupon her lately, for at Madame Dene’s Pension there were several\\nagreeable English and French ladies, and much interesting\\nconversation went on at the table, which Jenny heartily enjoyed,\\nthough she modestly said very little. But Ethel, longing to\\ndistinguish herself before the quiet English girls, tried to talk\\nand often made sad mistakes because her head was a jumble of new\\nnames and places, and her knowledge of all kinds very superficial.\\nOnly the day before she had said in a patronizing tone to a French\\nlady,--\\n\\n“Of course we remember our obligations to your Lamartine during our\\nRevolution, and the other brave Frenchmen who helped us.”\\n\\n“You mean Lafayette, dear,” whispered Jenny quickly, as the lady\\nsmiled and bowed bewildered by the queerly pronounced French, but\\ncatching the poet’s name.\\n\\n“I know what I mean; you needn’t trouble yourself to correct and\\ninterrupt me when I’m talking,” answered Ethel, in her pert way,\\nannoyed by a smile on the face of the girl opposite, and Jenny’s\\nblush at her rudeness and ingratitude. She regretted both when Jane\\nexplained the matter afterward, and wished that she had at once\\ncorrected what would then have passed as a slip of the tongue. Now\\nit was too late; but she kept quiet and gave Miss Cholmondeley no\\nmore chances to smile in that aggravatingly superior way, though it\\nwas very natural, as she was a highly educated girl.\\n\\nThinking of this, and many other mistakes of her own from which Jane\\ntried to save her, Ethel felt a real remorse, and walked silently\\non, wondering how she could reward this kind creature who had served\\nher so well and was so anxious to get on in her hard, humble way.\\nThe orders were all given now, the shopping nearly done, and\\nMademoiselle Campan, the elderly French lady who boarded at their\\nPension, was always ready to jaunt about and be useful; so why not\\ngive Jane a holiday, and let her grub and study for the little while\\nleft them in Paris? In a fortnight Uncle Sam was to pick up the\\ngirls and take them home, while the Homers went to Rome for the\\nwinter. It would be well to take Miss Bassett back in a good humor,\\nso that her report would please Mamma, and appease Papa if he were\\nangry at the amount of money spent by his extravagant little\\ndaughter. Ethel saw now, as one always does when it is too late to\\nrepair damages, many things left undone which she ought to have\\ndone, and regretted living for herself instead of putting more\\npleasure into the life of this good girl, whose future seemed so\\nuninviting to our young lady with her first season very near.\\n\\nIt was a kind plan, and gratified Jenny very much when it was\\nproposed and proved to her that no duty would be neglected if she\\nwent about with the Homers and left her charge to the excellent lady\\nwho enjoyed chiffons as much as Ethel did, and was glad to receive\\npretty gifts in return for her services.\\n\\nBut alas for Ethel’s good resolutions and Jenny’s well-earned\\nholiday! Both came to nothing, for Ethel fell ill from too much\\npastry, and had a sharp bilious attack which laid her up till the\\nuncle arrived.\\n\\nEvery one was very kind, and there was no danger; but the days were\\nlong, the invalid very fretful, and the nurse very tired, before the\\nsecond week brought convalescence and a general cheering and\\nclearing up took place. Uncle Sam was amusing himself very\\ncomfortably while he waited for his niece to be able to travel, and\\nthe girls were beginning to pack by degrees, for the accumulation of\\nEthel’s purchases made her share a serious task.\\n\\n“There! All are in now, and only the steamer trunk is left to pack\\nat the last moment,” said Jenny, folding her tired arms after a\\nprotracted struggle with half a dozen new gowns, and a perplexing\\nmedley of hats, boots, gloves, and perfumery. Two large trunks stood\\nin the ante-room ready to go; the third was now done, and nothing\\nremained but the small one and Jenny’s shabby portmanteau.\\n\\n“How nicely you have managed! I ought to have helped, only you\\nwouldn’t let me and I should have spoilt my wrapper. Come and rest\\nand help me sort out this rubbish,” said Ethel, who would have been\\ndressed and out if the arrival of a new peignoir had not kept her in\\nto enjoy the lovely pink and blue thing, all lace and ribbon and\\nFrench taste.\\n\\n“You will never get them into that box, dear,” answered Jenny,\\ngladly sitting down beside her on the sofa, which was strewn with\\ntrinkets of all sorts, more or less damaged by careless handling,\\nand the vicissitudes of a wandering trunk.\\n\\n“I don’t believe they are worth fussing over. I’m tired of them, and\\nthey look very mean and silly after seeing real jewels here. I’d\\nthrow them away if I hadn’t spent so much money on them,” said\\nEthel, turning over the tarnished filigree, mock pearl, and\\nimitation coral necklaces, bracelets, and brooches that were\\ntumbling out of the frail boxes in which they came.\\n\\n“They will look pretty to people at home who have not been seeing so\\nmany as we have. I’ll sew up the broken cases, and rub up the\\nsilver, and string the beads, and make all as good as new, and you\\nwill find plenty of girls at home glad to get them, I am sure,”\\n answered Jenny, rapidly bringing order out of chaos with those\\nskilful hands of hers.\\n\\nEthel leaned back and watched her silently for a few minutes. During\\nthis last week our young lady had been thinking a good deal, and was\\nconscious of a strong desire to tell Jane Bassett how much she loved\\nand thanked her for all her patient and faithful care during the six\\nmonths now nearly over. But she was proud, and humility was hard to\\nlearn; self-will was sweet, and to own one’s self in the wrong a\\nmost distasteful task. The penitent did not know how to begin, so\\nwaited for an opportunity, and presently it came.\\n\\n“Shall you be glad to get home, Jenny?” she asked in her most\\ncaressing tone, as she hung her prettiest locket round her friend’s\\nneck; for during this illness all formality and coolness had melted\\naway, and “Miss Bassett” was “Jenny dear” now.\\n\\n“I shall be very, very glad to see my precious people again, and\\ntell them all about my splendid holiday; but I can’t help wishing\\nthat we were to stay till spring, now that we are here, and I have\\nno teaching, and may never get such another chance. I’m afraid it\\nseems ungrateful when I’ve had so much; but to go back without\\nseeing Rome is a trial, I confess,” answered honest Jane, rubbing\\naway at a very dull paste bandeau.\\n\\n“So it is; but I don’t mind so much, because I shall come again\\nby-and-by, and I mean to be better prepared to enjoy things properly\\nthan I am now. I’ll really study this winter, and not be such a\\nfool. Jenny, I’ve a plan in my head. I wonder if you’d like it? I\\nshould immensely, and I’m going to propose it to Mamma the minute I\\nget home,” said Ethel, glad to seize this opening.\\n\\n“What is it, deary?”\\n\\n“Would you like to be my governess and teach me all you know,\\nquietly, at home this winter? I don’t want to begin school again\\njust for languages and a few finishing things, and I really think\\nyou would do more for me than any one else, because you know what I\\nneed, and are so patient with your bad, ungrateful, saucy girl.\\nCould you? would you come?” and Ethel put her arms round Jenny’s\\nneck with a little sob and a kiss that was far more precious to Jane\\nthan the famous diamond necklace of Marie Antoinette, which she had\\nbeen reading about.\\n\\n“I could and I would with all my heart, if you want me, darling! I\\nthink we know and love each other now, and can be happy and helpful\\ntogether, and I’ll come so gladly if your mother asks me,” answered\\nJenny, quick to understand what underlay this sudden tenderness, and\\nglad to accept the atonement offered her for many trials which she\\nwould never have told even to her own mother.\\n\\nEthel was her best self now, and her friend felt well rewarded for\\nthe past by this promise of real love and mutual help in the future.\\nSo they talked over the new plan in great spirits till Mrs. Homer\\ncame to bring them their share of a packet of home letters just\\narrived. She saw that something unusual was going on, but only\\nsmiled, nodded, and went away saying,--\\n\\n“I have good news in MY letters, and hope yours will make you\\nequally happy, girls.”\\n\\nSilence reigned for a time, as they sat reading busily; then a\\nsudden exclamation from Ethel seemed to produce a strange effect\\nupon Jenny, for with a cry of joy she sprang up and danced all over\\nthe room, waving her letter wildly as she cried out,--\\n\\n“I’m to go! I’m to go! I can’t believe it--but here it is! How\\nkind, how very kind, every one is to me!” and down she went upon her\\nown little bed to hide her face and laugh and cry till Ethel ran to\\nrejoice with her.\\n\\n“Oh, Jenny, I’m so glad! You deserve it, and it’s like Mrs. Homer to\\nmake all smooth before she said a word. Let me read what Mamma\\nwrites to you. Here’s my letter; see how sweetly she speaks of you,\\nand how grateful they are for all you’ve done for me.”\\n\\nThe letters changed hands; and sitting side by side in an\\naffectionate bunch, the girls read the happy news that granted the\\ncherished wish of one and gave the other real unselfish pleasure in\\nanother’s happiness.\\n\\nJane was to go to Rome with the Homers for the winter, and perhaps\\nto Greece in the spring. A year of delight lay before her, offered\\nin such a friendly way, and with such words of commendation, thanks,\\nand welcome, that the girl’s heart was full, and she felt that every\\nsmall sacrifice of feeling, every lonely hour, and distasteful duty\\nwas richly repaid by this rare opportunity to enjoy still further\\ndraughts of the wisdom, beauty, and poetry of the wonderful world\\nnow open to her.\\n\\nShe flew off presently to try to thank her good friends, and came\\nback dragging a light new trunk, in which she nearly buried her\\nsmall self as she excitedly explained its appearance, while rattling\\nout the trays and displaying its many conveniences.\\n\\n“That dear woman says I’m to send my presents home in the old one by\\nyou, and take this to fill up in Rome. Think of it! A lovely new\\nFrench trunk, and Rome full of pictures, statues, St. Peter’s, and\\nthe Colosseum. It takes my breath away and makes my head spin.”\\n\\n“So I see. It’s a capital box, but it won’t hold even St. Peter’s,\\ndear; so you’d better calm down and pack your treasures. I’ll help,”\\n cried Ethel, sweeping about in her gay gown, almost as wild as Jane,\\nwho was quite upset by this sudden delicious change in her\\nprospects.\\n\\nHow happily she laid away in the old trunk the few gifts she had\\nventured to buy, and those given her,--the glossy silk, the dainty\\nlace, the pretty crystals, the store of gloves, the flask of\\ncologne, the pictures and books, and last of all the sketches which\\nillustrated the journal kept so carefully for those at home.\\n\\n“Now, when my letter is written and the check with all that is left\\nof my salary put in, I am done. There’s room for more, and I wish\\nI’d got something else, now I feel so rich. But it is foolish to buy\\ngowns to pay duties on, when I don’t know what the girls need. I\\nfeel so rich now, I shall fly out and pick up some more little\\npretties for the dears. They have so few, anything will be charming\\nto them,” said Jenny, proudly surveying her box, and looking about\\nfor some foreign trifle with which to fill up the corners.\\n\\n“Then let me put these in, and so be rid of them. I shall go to see\\nyour people and tell them all about you, and explain how you came to\\nsend so much rubbish.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ethel slipped in several Swiss carvings, the best of\\nthe trinkets, and a parcel of dainty Parisian ties and sashes which\\nwould gladden the hearts of the poor, pretty girls, just beginning\\nto need such aids to their modest toilets. A big box of bonbons\\ncompleted her contribution, and left but one empty corner.\\n\\n“I’ll tuck in my old hat to keep all steady; the girls will like it\\nwhen they dress up, and I’m fond of it, because it recalls some of\\nmy happiest days,” said Jenny, as she took up the well-worn hat and\\nbegan to dust it. A shower of grain dropped into her hand, for the\\nyellow wheat still kept its place and recalled the chat at\\nSchwalbach. Ethel glanced at her own hat with its faded artificial\\nflowers; and as her eye went from the small store of treasures so\\ncarefully and happily gathered to the strew of almost useless finery\\non her bed, she said soberly,--\\n\\n“You were right, Jenny. My poppies are worthless, and my harvest a\\nvery poor one. Your wheat fell in good ground, and you will glean a\\nwhole stack before you go home. Well, I shall keep MY old hat to\\nremind me of you: and when I come again, I hope I shall have a wiser\\nhead to put into a new one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITTLE BUTTON-ROSE\\n\\n\\n“If you please, I’ve come,” said a small girl, as she walked into a\\nlarge room where three ladies sat at work.\\n\\nOne of the ladies was very thin, one very stout, and the youngest\\nvery pretty. The eldest put on her glasses, the stout one dropped\\nher sewing, and the pretty one exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Why, it must be little Rosamond!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve come; the man is taking my trunk upstairs, and I’ve got a\\nletter for Cousin Penelope,” said the child, with the sweet\\ncomposure of one always sure of a welcome.\\n\\nThe stout lady held out her hand for the letter; but the little\\ngirl, after a keen look at the three faces, went to the old lady,\\nwho received her with a kiss, saying,--\\n\\n“That’s right; but how did you know, dear?”\\n\\n“Oh, Papa said Cousin Penny is old, Cousin Henny fat, and Cousin\\nCicely rather pretty; so I knew in one minute,” replied Rosamond, in\\na tone of innocent satisfaction at her own cleverness, and quite\\nunconscious of the effect of her speech.\\n\\nMiss Penelope hastily retired behind the letter. Miss Henrietta\\nfrowned so heavily that the gold-rimmed eye-glasses flew off her\\nnose with a clash, and Cicely laughed outright, as she exclaimed,--\\n\\n“I’m afraid we have got an enfant terrible among us, though I can’t\\ncomplain of my share of the compliments.”\\n\\n“I never expected to find Clara’s child well mannered, and I see I\\nwas quite right. Take your hat off, Rosamond, and sit down. It tires\\nSister to lean on her in that way,” said Miss Henny in a severe\\ntone, with no offer of any warmer welcome.\\n\\nSeeing that something was amiss, the child quietly obeyed, and\\nperching herself in an ancient arm-chair crossed her short legs,\\nfolded her plump hands over the diminutive travelling-bag she\\ncarried, and sat looking about the room with a pair of very large\\nblue eyes, quite unabashed, though rather pensive, as if the memory\\nof some tender parting were still fresh in her little heart.\\n\\nWhile Miss Penny slowly reads the letter, Miss Henny works daisies\\non a bit of canvas with pettish jerks of her silk, and Miss Cicely\\nleans in the sofa-corner, staring at the newcomer, we will briefly\\nintroduce our small heroine. Her father was cousin to the elder\\nladies, and being called suddenly across the water on business, took\\nhis wife with him, leaving the little girl to the care of these\\nrelatives, thinking her too young for so long a journey. Cicely, an\\norphan niece who lived with the old ladies, was to have the care of\\nRosy; and a summer in the quiet country town would do her good,\\nwhile change of scene would console her for this first separation\\nfrom her mother. How she fared remains to be seen; and we need only\\nadd that the child had been well trained, made the companion of a\\nsweet and tender woman, and was very anxious to please the parents\\nwhom she passionately loved, by keeping the promises she had made\\nthem, and being “as brave as Papa, as patient and kind as dear\\nMamma.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think of it, Missy?” asked Cicely, as the blue\\neyes came back to her, after roving round the spacious,\\nold-fashioned, and rather gloomy room.\\n\\n“It’s a pretty large, dark place for a little girl to be all alone\\nin;” and there was a suspicious quiver in the childish voice, as\\nRosy opened her bag to produce a very small handkerchief, evidently\\nfeeling that she might have sudden need of it if some one did not\\nspeak to her very soon.\\n\\n“We keep it dark on account of Sister’s eyes. When _I_ was a little\\ngirl, it wasn’t considered polite to say rude things about other\\npeople’s houses, especially if they were very handsome ones,” said\\nMiss Henny, with a stern glance over the eye-glasses at the young\\noffender, whose second remark was even more unfortunate than her\\nfirst.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be rude, but I MUST tell the truth. Little girls\\nlike bright places. I’m sorry about Cousin Penny’s eyes. I will read\\nto her; I do to Mamma, and she says it is very well for a child only\\neight years old.”\\n\\nThe gentle answer and the full eyes seemed to calm Miss Henny’s\\nwrath, for her size was her tender point, and the old house her\\nespecial pride; so she dropped the awe-inspiring glasses, and said\\nmore kindly,--\\n\\n“There is a nice little room ready for you upstairs, and a garden to\\nplay in. Cicely will hear you read every day, and I will teach you\\nto sew, for of course that MOST useful part of your education has\\nbeen neglected.”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, I sew my four patches every day, and make little wee\\nstitches, and I can hem Papa’s hank’chifs, and I was learning to\\ndarn his socks with a big needle when--when they went away.”\\n\\nRosy paused with a sudden choke; but too proud to break down, she\\nonly wiped two drops off her cheek with the long ends of her little\\ngray silk glove, set her lips, and remained mistress of herself,\\nprivately planning to cry all she liked when she was safely in the\\n“nice little room” promised her.\\n\\nCicely, though a lazy, selfish young lady, was touched by the\\nchild’s pathetic face, and said in a friendly tone, as she patted\\nthe couch where she lay,--\\n\\n“Come here, dear, and sit by me, and tell me what kind of a kitten\\nyou’d like best. I know of a sweet yellow one, and two grays. Our\\nTabby is too old to play with you; so you will want a kitty, I’m\\nsure.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, if I may!” and Rosy skipped to the new seat with a smile\\nwhich plainly proved that this sort of welcome was just what she\\nliked.\\n\\n“Now, Cicely, why will you put such an idea into Rosamond’s head\\nwhen you know we can’t have kittens round the house for Sister to\\nstumble over, not to mention the mischief the horrid things always\\ndo? Tabby is all the child needs, with her doll. Of course you have\\na doll?” and Miss Henny asked the question as solemnly as if she had\\nsaid, “Have you a soul?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I have nine in my trunk, and two little ones in my bag, and\\nMamma is going to send me a big, big one from London, as soon as she\\ngets there, to sleep with me and be my little comfort,” cried Rosy,\\nrapidly producing from her bag a tiny bride and groom, three\\nseed-cakes, a smelling-bottle, and a purse out of which fell a shower of\\nbright cents, also crumbs all over the immaculate carpet.\\n\\n“Mercy on us, what a mess! Pick it all up, child, and don’t unpack\\nany more in the parlor. One doll is quite enough for me,” said Miss\\nHenny, with a sigh of resignation as if asking patience to bear this\\nnew calamity.\\n\\nRosy echoed the sigh as she crept about reclaiming her precious\\npennies, and eating the crumbs as the only way of disposing of them.\\n\\n“Never mind, it’s only her way; the heat makes her a little cross,\\nyou see,” whispered Cicely, bending down to hold the bag, into which\\nRosy bundled her treasures in hot haste.\\n\\n“I thought fat people were always pleasant. I’m glad YOU ain’t fat,”\\n answered the little girl, in a tone which was perfectly audible.\\n\\nWhat would have happened I tremble to think, if Miss Penny had not\\nfinished the letter at that moment and handed it to her sister,\\nsaying as she held out her arms to the child,--\\n\\n“Now I know all about it, and you are to be my baby; so come and\\ngive me some sweet kisses, darling.”\\n\\nDown dropped the bag, and with a little sob of joy the child nestled\\nclose to the kind old heart that welcomed her so tenderly at last.\\n\\n“Papa calls me his button-rose, ‘cause I’m so small and pink and\\nsweet, and thorny too sometimes,” she said, looking up brightly,\\nafter a few moments of the fond and foolish cuddling all little\\ncreatures love and need so much when they leave the nest, and miss\\nthe brooding of motherly wings.\\n\\n“We’ll call you anything you like, darling; but Rosamond is a pretty\\nold name, and I’m fond of it, for it was your grandmamma’s, and a\\nsweeter woman never lived,” said Miss Penny, stroking the fresh\\ncheeks, where the tears shone like dew on pink rose-leaves.\\n\\n“I shall call you Chicken Little, because we have Henny and Penny;\\nand the girls and Tab downstairs can be Goosey-Loosey, Turkey-Lurkey,\\nand Cocky-Locky. I’ll be Ducky-Lucky, and I’m sure Foxy-Loxy lives\\nnext door,” said Cicely, laughing at her own wit, while Miss Henny\\nlooked up, saying, with the first smile Rosy had seen,--\\n\\n“That’s true enough! and I hope Chicken Little will keep out of his\\nway, no matter if the sky does fall.”\\n\\n“Who is it? A truly fox? I never saw one. Could I peep at him\\nsometimes?” cried the child, much interested at once.\\n\\n“No, dear; it’s only a neighbor of ours who has treated us badly, at\\nleast we think so, and we don’t speak, though we used to be good\\nfriends some years ago. It’s sad to live so, but we don’t quite see\\nhow to help it yet. We are ready to do our part; but Mr. Dover\\nshould take the first step, as he was in the wrong.”\\n\\n“Please tell about it. I have horrid quarrels with Mamie Parsons\\nsometimes, but we always kiss and make up, and feel all happy again.\\nCan’t you, Cousin Penny?” asked the child, softly touching the\\nlittle white curls under the lace cap.\\n\\n“Well, no, dear; grown people cannot settle differences in that\\npretty way. We must wait till he apologizes, and then we shall\\ngladly be friends again. You see Mr. Dover was a missionary in India\\nfor many years, and we were very intimate with his mother. Our\\ngardens join, and a gate in our fence led across their field to the\\nback street, and was most convenient when we wanted to walk by the\\nriver or send the maids on errands in a hurry. The old lady was very\\nneighborly, and we were quite comfortable till Thomas came home and\\nmade trouble. He’d lost his wife and children, poor man, and his\\nliver was out of order, and living among the heathen so long had\\nmade him melancholy and queer; so he tried to amuse himself with\\ngardening and keeping hens.”\\n\\n“I’m glad! I love flowers and biddies,” murmured Rosy, listening\\nwith deep interest to this delightful mixture of quarrels and\\nheathen, sorrow, poultry, mysterious diseases, and gardens.\\n\\n“He had no right to shut up our gate and forbid our crossing that\\nlittle field, and no GENTLEMAN would have DARED to do it after all\\nour kindness to his mother,” exclaimed Miss Henny, so suddenly and\\nviolently that Rosamond nearly fell off the old lady’s lap with the\\nstart she gave.\\n\\n“No, sister, I don’t agree there. Mr. Thomas had a perfect RIGHT to\\ndo as he liked with his own land; but I think we should have had no\\ntrouble if you had been willing to sell him the corner of our garden\\nwhere the old summer-house is, for his hens,” began Miss Penny in a\\nmild tone.\\n\\n“Sister! you know the tender memories connected with that bower, and\\nhow terrible it would have been to ME to see it torn down, and noisy\\nfowls clucking and pecking where I and my poor Calvin once sat\\ntogether,” cried Miss Henny, trying to look sentimental, which was\\nan impossible feat for a stout lady in a flowery muslin gown, and a\\nfly-away cap full of blue ribbons, on a head once flaxen and now\\ngray.\\n\\n“We won’t discuss the point, Henrietta,” said the elder lady with\\ndignity; whereupon the other returned to the letter, bridling and\\ntossing her head in a way which caused Rosy to stare, and resolve to\\nimitate it when she played being a proud princess with her dolls.\\n\\n“Well, dear, that was the beginning of the trouble,” continued Miss\\nPenny; “and now we don’t speak, and the old lady misses us, I’m\\nsure, and I often long to run in and see her, and I’m so sorry you\\ncan’t enjoy the wonders of that house, for it’s full of beautiful\\nand curious things, most instructive for children to observe. Mr.\\nThomas has been a great traveller, and has a tiger skin in the\\nparlor so natural it’s quite startling to behold; also spears, and\\nbows and arrows, and necklaces of shark’s teeth, from the Cannibal\\nIslands, and the loveliest stuffed birds, my dear, all over the\\nplace, and pretty shells and baskets, and ivory toys, and odd\\ndresses, and no end of wonderful treasures. Such a sad pity you\\ncan’t see them!” and Miss Penny looked quite distressed at the\\nchild’s loss.\\n\\n“Oh, but I guess I will see ‘em! Every one is good to me, and old\\ngentlemen like little girls. Papa says so, and HE always does what I\\nwant when I say ‘Please’ with my wheedulin smile, as he calls it,”\\n said Rosy, giving them a sample of the most engaging sort.\\n\\n“You funny little thing, do try it, and soften the heart of that\\ntiresome man! He has the finest roses in town and the most delicious\\nfruit, and we never get any, though he sends quantities everywhere\\nelse. Such a fuss over an old ear-wiggy arbor! It is perfectly\\nprovoking, when we might enjoy so much over there; and who knows\\nwhat might happen!”\\n\\nAs Cicely spoke, she smoothed her brown curls and glanced at the\\nmirror, quite conscious that a very pretty young lady of twenty was\\nwasting her sweetness in the great gloomy house, with two elderly\\nspinsters.\\n\\n“I’ll get some for you,” answered Rosy, with a nod of such calm\\nconviction of her own power, that Cicely laughed again, and proposed\\nthat she should go at once and view the battle-field.\\n\\n“Could I RUN in the garden? I’d love to, after riding so long,”\\n asked Rosy, eager to be off; for her active legs ached for exercise,\\nand the close, shady room oppressed her.\\n\\n“Yes, dear; but don’t get into mischief, or worry Tabby, or pick the\\nflowers. Of course you wouldn’t touch green fruit, or climb trees,\\nor soil your little frock. I’ll ring the bell for you to come in and\\nbe dressed for tea when it is time.”\\n\\nWith these directions and a kiss, Miss Penny, as Cicely did not\\nstir, let the child out at the back door of the long hall, and\\nwatched her walk demurely down the main path of the prim old garden,\\nwhere no child had played for years, and even the toads and fat\\nrobins behaved in the most decorous manner.\\n\\n“It’s pretty dull, but it’s better than the parlor with all the\\nstaring pictures,” said Rosy to herself, after a voyage of discovery\\nhad shown her the few charms of the place. The sight of a large\\nyellow cat reposing in the sun cheered her eyes at that moment, and\\nshe hastened to scrape acquaintance with the stately animal; for the\\nsnails were not social, and the toads stared even more fixedly at\\nher than the painted eyes of her respected ancestors.\\n\\nBut Tabby disliked children as much as her mistress, and after\\nsubmitting ungraciously to a few caresses from the eager little\\nhands, she rose and retired majestically to a safer perch on the top\\nof the high wall which enclosed the garden. Being too lazy to jump,\\nshe walked up the shelves of an old flower-stand moulding in a\\ncorner, and by so doing, gave Rosy a brilliant idea, which she at\\nonce put into action by following Tabby’s example. Up this new sort\\nof ladder she went, and peeped over the wall, delighted at this\\nunexpected chance to behold the enemy’s territory.\\n\\n“Oh, what a pretty place!” she cried, clasping her grubby little\\nhands with rapture, as the beauties of the forbidden land burst upon\\nher view.\\n\\nIt was indeed a paradise to a child’s eyes,--for flowers bloomed\\nalong the winding paths; ripening fruit lay rosy and tempting in the\\nbeds below; behind the wire walls that confined them clucked and\\nstrutted various sorts of poultry; cages of gay birds hung on the\\npiazza; and through the open windows of the house one caught\\nglimpses of curious curtains, bright weapons, and mysterious objects\\nin the rooms beyond.\\n\\nA gray-headed gentleman in a queer nankeen coat lay asleep on a\\nbamboo lounge under the great cherry-tree, with a purple silk\\nhandkerchief half over his face.\\n\\n“That’s the missionary man, I s’pose. He doesn’t look cross at all.\\nIf I could only get down there, I’d go and wake him with a softly\\nkiss, as I do Papa, and ask to see his pretty things.”\\n\\nBeing quite unconscious of fear, Rosy certainly would have carried\\nout her daring plan, had it been possible; but no way of descending\\non the other side appeared, so she sighed and sat gazing wistfully,\\ntill Cousin Henny appeared for a breath of fresh air, and ordered\\nher down at once.\\n\\n“Come and see if my balsam-seeds have started yet. I keep planting\\nthem, but they WON’T come up,” she said, pointing out a mound of\\nearth newly dug and watered.\\n\\nRosy obediently scrambled up, and was trying to decide whether some\\ngreen sprouts were chickweed or the dilatory balsams when a sudden\\nuproar in the next garden made her stop to listen, while Miss Henny\\nsaid in a tone of great satisfaction, as the cackle of hens arose,--\\n\\n“Some trouble with those horrid fowls of his. I detest them, crowing\\nin the night, and waking us at dawn with their noise. I wish some\\nthief would steal every one of them. Nobody has a right to annoy\\ntheir neighbors with troublesome pets.”\\n\\nBefore Rosy could describe the beauties of the white bantams or the\\nsize of the big golden cock, a loud voice cried,--\\n\\n“You rascal! I’ll hang you if I catch you here again. Go home\\nquicker than you came, and tell your mistress to teach you better\\nmanners, if she values your life.”\\n\\n“It’s that man! Such language! I wonder who he’s caught? That bad\\nboy who steals our plums, perhaps.”\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of Miss Henny’s mouth when her question\\nwas answered in a sudden and dreadful way; for over the wall, hurled\\nby a strong arm, flew Tabby, high in the air, to fall with a thump\\ndirectly in the middle of the bed where they stood. Miss Henny\\nuttered a shrill scream, caught up her stunned treasure, and rushed\\ninto the house as fast as her size and flounces permitted, leaving\\nRosy breathless with surprise and indignation.\\n\\nBurning to resent this terrible outrage, she climbed quickly up the\\nsteps, and astonished the irate old gentleman on the other side by\\nthe sudden apparition of a golden head, a red childish face, and a\\ndirty little finger pointed sternly at him, as this small avenging\\nangel demanded,--\\n\\n“Missionary man, how COULD you kill my cousin’s cat?”\\n\\n“Bless my soul! who are you?” said the old gentleman, staring at\\nthis unexpected actor on the field of battle.\\n\\n“I’m Button-Rose, and I hate cruel people! Tabby’s dead, and now\\nthere isn’t any one to play with over here.”\\n\\nThis sad prospect made the blue eyes fill with sudden tears; and the\\napplication of the dirty fingers added streaks of mud to the red\\ncheeks, which much damaged the appearance of the angel, thought it\\nadded pathos to the child’s reproach.\\n\\n“Cats have nine lives, and Tabby’s used to being chucked over the\\nwall. I’ve done it several times, and it seems to agree with her,\\nfor she comes back to kill my chicks as bold as brass. See that!”\\n and the old gentleman held up a downy dead chicken, as proof of\\nTabby’s sin.\\n\\n“Poor little chicky!” groaned Rosy, yearning to mourn over the dear\\ndeparted and bury it with tender care. “It WAS very naughty of Tab;\\nbut, sir, you know cats are made to catch things, and they can’t\\nhelp it.”\\n\\n“They will have to help it, or I’ll drown the lot. This is a rare\\nbreed, and I’ve but two left after all my trouble, thanks to that\\nrascal of yours! What are you going to do about it?” demanded Mr.\\nDover, in a tone that made Rosy feel as if she had committed the\\nmurder herself.\\n\\n“I’ll talk to Tabby and try to make her good, and I’ll shut her up\\nin the old rabbit-house over here; then I hope she will be sorry and\\nnever do it any more,” she said, in such a remorseful tone that the\\nold gentleman relented at once, ashamed to afflict such a tender\\nlittle soul.\\n\\n“Try it,” he said, with a smile that made his yellow face pleasant\\nall at once. Then, as if ready to change the subject, he asked,\\nlooking curiously at the little figure perched on the wall,--\\n\\n“Where did you come from? Never saw any children over there before.\\nThey don’t allow ‘em.”\\n\\nRosy introduced herself in a few words, and seeing that her new\\nacquaintance seemed interested, she added with the wheedling smile\\nPapa found so engaging,--\\n\\n“It’s pretty lonely here, I guess; so p’r’aps you’ll let me peep at\\nyour nice garden sometimes if it doesn’t trouble you, sir?”\\n\\n“Poor little soul! it must be desperately dull with those three\\ntabbies,” he said to himself, as he stroked the dead chicken in his\\nhand, and watched the little face bent toward him.\\n\\n“Peep as much as you like, child; or, better still, come over and\\nrun about. _I_ like little girls,” he added aloud, with a nod and a\\nwave of welcome.\\n\\n“I told ‘em I was sure you did! I’d love to come, but they wouldn’t\\nlet me, I know. I’m so sorry about the fight. Couldn’t you make it\\nup, and be pleasant again?” asked Rosy, clasping her hands with a\\nbeseeching gesture as her bright face grew sad and serious\\nremembering the feud.\\n\\n“So they’ve told you that nonsense already, have they? Nice\\nneighbors THEY are,” said the old gentleman, frowning as if ill\\npleased at the news.\\n\\n“I’m glad I know; p’r’aps I can be a peace-maker. Mamma says they\\nare good to have in families, and I’d like to be one if I could.\\nWould you mind if I tried to peace-make a little, so I could come\\nover? I do want to see the red birds and the tiger skin awfully, if\\nyou please.”\\n\\n“What do you know about ‘em?” asked the old gentleman, sitting down\\non a garden chair, as if he didn’t mind continuing the chat with\\nthis new neighbor.\\n\\nNearly tumbling off the wall in her earnestness, Rosy repeated all\\nthat Cousin Penny had said; and something in the reasonable words,\\nthe flattering description of his treasures, and the sincere regret\\nof the old lady seemed to have a good effect upon Mr. Dover, for\\nwhen Rosy paused out of breath, he said in such an altered tone that\\nit was evident the peacemaking had already begun,--\\n\\n“Miss Carey is a gentlewoman! I always thought so. You tell her,\\nwith my compliments, that I’d be glad to see you any time if she has\\nno objection. I’ll put my step-ladder there, and you can come over\\ninstead of the cat. But mind you don’t meddle, or I might give you a\\ntoss like Tabby.”\\n\\n“I’m not afraid,” laughed Rosy. “I’ll go and ask right away, and I\\nwon’t touch a thing, and I know you’ll like me for a friend. Papa\\nsays I’m a dear little one. Thank you very much, sir. Good-by till I\\ncome again;” and with a kiss of the hand, the yellow head sunk out\\nof sight like the sun going down, leaving a sense of darkness behind\\nwhen the beaming little face disappeared, though fresh stains of\\ngreen mould from the wall made it rather like the tattooed\\ncountenances Mr. Dover used to see among his cannibal friends in\\nAfrica.\\n\\nHe sat musing with the dead chicken in his hand, forgetful of time,\\ntill a ring of his own door-bell called him in to receive a note\\nfrom Miss Penelope, thanking him for his invitation to little\\nRosamond, but declining it in the most polite and formal words.\\n\\n“I expected it! Bless the silly old souls! why can’t they be\\nreasonable, and accept the olive branch when I offer it? I’ll be\\nhanged if I do again! The fat one is at the bottom of this. Miss Pen\\nwould give in if that absurd Henrietta didn’t hold her back. Well,\\nI’m sorry for the child, but that’s not my fault;” and throwing down\\nthe note, he went out to water his roses.\\n\\nFor a week or two, Button-Rose hardly dared glance toward the\\nforbidden spot from her window, as she was ordered to play in the\\nfront garden, and sent to take sober walks with Cicely, who loved to\\nstop and gossip with her friends, while the poor child waited\\npatiently till the long tales were told.\\n\\nNursing Tabby was her chief consolation; and so kind was she, that\\nthe heart of the old cat softened to her, and she actually purred\\nher thanks at last, for all the saucers of cream, bits of chicken,\\nsoft pats, and tender words bestowed upon her by the little girl.\\n\\n“Well, I declare! Tab won’t do that even for me,” said Miss Henny,\\none day when she came upon the child sitting alone in the hall with\\na picture-book and the cat comfortably asleep in her lap.\\n\\n“Ammals always love me, if people don’t,” answered Button-Rose,\\nsoberly; for she had not yet forgiven the stout lady for denying her\\nthe delights offered by the “missionary man.”\\n\\n“That’s because AN-I-MALS can’t see how naughty you are sometimes,”\\n said Miss Henny tartly, not having recovered her temper even after\\nmany days.\\n\\n“I shall make EVERY one love me before I go away. Mamma told me to,\\nand I shall. I know how;” and Button smiled with a wise little nod\\nthat was pretty to see, as she proudly cuddled her first conquest.\\n\\n“We shall see;” and Miss Henny ponderously departed, wondering what\\nodd fancy the little thing would take into her head next.\\n\\nIt was soon evident; for when she came down from her long nap, later\\nin the afternoon, Miss Henny found Rosamond reading aloud to her\\nsister in the great dim parlor. They made a curious contrast,--the\\npale, white-haired, feeble old lady, with her prim dress, high cap,\\nknitting, and shaded eyes; and the child, rosy and round, quaint and\\nsweet, a pretty little ornament for the old-fashioned room, as she\\nsat among the tea-poys and samplers, ancient china and furniture,\\nwith the portraits of great grandfathers and grandmothers simpering\\nand staring at her, as if pleased and surprised to see such a\\ncharming little descendant among them.\\n\\n“Bless the baby! what is she at now?” asked Miss Henny, feeling more\\namiable after her sleep.\\n\\n“I’m reading to Cousin Penny, ‘cause no one else does, and her poor\\neyes hurt her, and she likes stories, and so do I,” answered Button,\\nwith one chubby finger on the place in her book, and eyes full of\\npride at the grown-up employment she had found for herself.\\n\\n“So kind of the little dear! She found me alone and wanted to amuse\\nme; so I proposed a story to suit us both, and she does very well\\nwith a little help now and then. I haven’t read ‘Simple Susan’ for\\nyears, and really enjoy it. Maria Edgeworth was always a favorite of\\nmine, and I still think her far superior to any modern writer for\\nthe young,” said Miss Penny, looking quite animated and happy in the\\nnew entertainment provided for her.\\n\\n“Go on, child; let me hear how well you can read;” and Miss Henny\\nsettled herself in the sofa-corner with her embroidery.\\n\\nSo Button started bravely on, and tried so hard that she was soon\\nout of breath. As she paused, she said with a gasp,--\\n\\n“Isn’t Susan a dear girl? She gives ALL the best things to other\\npeople, and is kind to the old harper. She didn’t send him away, as\\nyou did the music-man to-day, and tell him to be still.”\\n\\n“Organs are a nuisance, and I never allow them here. Go on, and\\ndon’t criticise your elders, Rosamond.”\\n\\n“Mamma and I always talk over stories, and pick out the morals of\\n‘em. SHE likes it;” with which remark, made sweetly not pertly,\\nButton went on to the end, with an occasional lift over a long word;\\nand the old ladies were interested, in spite of themselves, in the\\nsimple tale read in that childish voice.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear, it is very nice, and we will have one every day.\\nNow, what can I do for you?” asked Miss Penny, as the little girl\\npushed the curls off her forehead, with a sigh of mingled weariness\\nand satisfaction.\\n\\n“Let me go in the back garden and peep through the knot-hole at the\\npretty roses. I do long to see if the moss ones are out, and the\\ncherries ripe,” said Rosy, clasping her hands imploringly.\\n\\n“It can do no harm, Henrietta. Yes, dear, run away and get some\\ncatnip for Tabby, and see if the balsams are up yet.”\\n\\nThat last suggestion won Miss Henny’s consent; and Button was off at\\nonce, skipping like a young colt all over the garden, which now\\nseemed delightful to her.\\n\\nAt the back of the summer-house was a narrow space between it and\\nthe fence where certain plump toads lived; peeping in to watch them,\\nRosy had spied a large knot-hole in the old boards, and through it\\nfound she could get a fine view of several rose-bushes, a tree, and\\none window of the “missionary man’s” house. She had longed for\\nanother peep since the flower-stand was gone, and climbing trees\\nforbidden; now with joy she slipped into the damp nook, regardless\\nof the speckled gentlemen who stared at her with dismay, and took a\\ngood look at the forbidden paradise beyond.\\n\\nYes, the “moss ones” were in bloom, the cherries quite red, and at\\nthe window was the gray head of Mr. Dover, as he sat reading in his\\nqueer yellow dressing-gown.\\n\\nButton yearned to get in, and leaned so hard against the hateful\\nfence that the rotten board cracked, a long bit fell out, and she\\nnearly went after it, as it dropped upon the green bank below. Now\\nthe full splendor of the roses burst upon her, and a delightful\\ngooseberry bush stood close by with purplish berries temptingly\\nbobbing within reach. This obliging bush hid the hole, but left fine\\nopenings to see through; so the child popped her curly head out, and\\ngazed delightedly at the chickens, the flowers, the fruit, and the\\nunconscious old gentleman not far away.\\n\\n“I’ll have it for my secret; or maybe I’ll tell Cousin Penny, and\\nbeg her to let me peep if I truly promise never to go in,” thought\\nButton, knowing well who her best friend was.\\n\\nAt bedtime, when the dear old lady came to give the good-night kiss,\\nwhich the others forgot, Rosy, as Miss Penny called her, made her\\nrequest; and it was granted, for Miss Penny had a feeling that the\\nlittle peacemaker would sooner or later heal the breach with her\\npretty magic, and so she was very ready to lend a hand in a quiet\\nway.\\n\\nNext day at play-time, Button was hurrying down her last bit of\\ngingerbread, which she was obliged to eat properly in the\\ndining-room, instead of enjoying out-of-doors, when she heard a\\nsudden flurry in the garden, and running to the window saw Roxy the\\nmaid chasing a chicken to and fro, while Miss Henny stood flapping\\nher skirts on the steps, and crying, “Shoo!” till she was red in the\\nface.\\n\\n“It’s the white banty, and it must have come in my hole! Oh dear, I\\nhope they won’t catch it! Cousin Henny said she’d wring the neck of\\nthe first one that flied over the wall.”\\n\\nAway went Rosy, to join in the hunt; for Miss Henny was too fat to\\nrun, and Roxy found the lively fowl too much for her. It was a long\\nand hard chase; feathers flew, the maid lost her breath, Rosy\\ntumbled down, and Miss Henny screamed and scolded till she was\\nforced to sit down and watch in silence.\\n\\nAt last poor, hunted Banty ran into the arbor, for its clipped wings\\nwould not lift it over the wall. Button rushed after it, and dismal\\nsqualls plainly proclaimed that the naughty chicken was caught.\\n\\nMiss Henny waddled down the path, declaring that she WOULD wring its\\nneck; and Roxy went puffing after her, glad to rest. But the old\\nsummer-house was empty. No little girl, no ruffled bantam, appeared.\\nBoth had vanished like magic; and mistress and maid stared at each\\nother in amazement, till they saw that the long-disused window was\\nopen, and a gleam of light came in from the narrow opening behind.\\n\\n“My patience! if that child hasn’t crept out there, and bolted\\nthrough that hole in the fence! Did you ever, Miss?” exclaimed Roxy,\\ntrying not to look pleased at being spared the distasteful task of\\nkilling the poor chicken.\\n\\n“Naughty girl!” began Miss Henny, when the sound of voices made both\\nlisten. “Slip in there, and see what is going on,” said the\\nmistress, well knowing that her stout person never could be squeezed\\ninto the small space between house and fence.\\n\\nRoxy, being thin, easily obeyed, and in a whisper telephoned what\\nwent on beyond the hole, causing Miss Henny much vexation, surprise,\\nand at last real pleasure, as the child performed her little part in\\nthe mission she had undertaken.\\n\\n“Oh, please, it’s all my fault! I kept the hole open, Mr. Thomas,\\nand so Banty flied in. But it isn’t hurt a bit, and I’ve brought it\\nhome all safe, ‘cause I know you love your chickies, and Tabby ate\\nlots of ‘em,” said the childish voice in its most conciliatory tone.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you fling it over the wall, as I did the cat?” asked Mr.\\nDover, smiling, as he shut up the truant fowl, and turned to look at\\nthe rosy, breathless child, whose pink frock bore the marks of many\\na tumble on grass and gravel.\\n\\n“It would hurt Banty’s feelings, and yours too, and not be polite.\\nSo I came myself, to make some pollygies, and say it was my fault.\\nBut, please, could I keep the hole to peep through, if I always put\\nup a board when I go away? It is so dull in there, and SO sweet in\\nhere!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think a little gate would be nicer,--one just big enough\\nfor you, with a hook to fasten it? We’ll call it a button-hole,”\\n laughed Mr. Dover. “Then you could peep; or perhaps the ladies will\\nthink better of it, and show that they pardon my ill treatment of\\nTabby by letting you come in and pick some cherries and roses now\\nand then.”\\n\\nThis charming proposal caused the little girl to clasp her hands and\\ncry aloud,--\\n\\n“That would be perfully sp’endid! I know Cousin Penny would like it,\\nand let me. P’r’aps she’d come herself; she’s so thin, she could,\\nand she loves your mother and wants to see her. Only, Cousin Henny\\nwon’t let us be nice and friendly. S’pose you send HER some\\ncherries; she loves good things to eat, and maybe she will say yes,\\nif you send lots.”\\n\\nMr. Dover laughed at this artless proposal, and Miss Henny smiled at\\nthe prospect of a gift of the luscious black-heart cherries she had\\nbeen longing for. Roxy wisely repeated only the agreeable parts of\\nthe conversation; so nothing ruffled the lady’s temper. Now, whether\\nMr. Dover’s sharp eye caught a glimpse of the face among the\\ngooseberry bushes, and suspected eavesdroppers, or whether the\\nchild’s earnest desire to make peace touched him, who shall say?\\nCertain it is that his eyes twinkled like a boy’s, as he said rather\\nloudly, in his most affable tone,--\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to send Miss Henrietta a basket of fruit. She\\nused to be a charming young woman. It’s a pity she shuts herself up\\nso much; but that sad little romance of hers has darkened her life,\\nI suppose. Ah, well, I can sympathize with her!”\\n\\nRosy stared at the sudden change in his manner, and was rather\\nbewildered by his grown-up way of talking to her. But being intent\\non securing something nice to carry home, she stuck to the cherries,\\nwhich she DID understand, and pointing to the piazza said with a\\nbusiness-like air,--\\n\\n“There’s a basket; so we might pick ‘em right away. I love to go up\\nin trees and throw ‘em down; and I know Cousin Henny will like\\ncherries ever so much, and not scold a bit when I take some to her.”\\n\\n“Then come on,” cried Mr. Thomas, relapsing into the hearty manner\\nshe liked so much; and away he went, quite briskly, down the path,\\nwith his yellow skirts waving in the wind, and Button skipping after\\nhim in great glee.\\n\\n“They actually ARE a-picking cherries, Miss, up in the tree like a\\ncouple of robins a-chirpin’ and laughin’ as gay as can be,” reported\\nRoxy, from her peep-hole.\\n\\n“Rip off the rest of that board, then I can see,” whispered Miss\\nHenny, quivering with interest now; for she had heard Mr. Dover’s\\nwords, and her wrath was appeased by that flattering allusion to\\nherself.\\n\\nOff came the rest of the board, and from the window, half hidden in\\nwoodbine, she could now see over the bushes into the next garden.\\nThe peep-hole commanded the tree, and she watched with eager eyes\\nthe filling of the basket to be sent her, planning the while a\\ncharming note of thanks.\\n\\n“Do look, Miss; they are resting now, and she’s on his knee. Ain’t\\nit a pretty picter?” whispered Roxy, unmindful of the earwigs, ants,\\nand daddy-long-legs promenading over her as she crouched in her\\nmouldy corner, intent on the view beyond.\\n\\n“Very pretty! He lost several children in India and I suppose Rosy\\nreminds him of them. Ah, poor man! I can sympathize with him, for\\n_I_ too have loved and lost,” sighed Miss Henny, pensively surveying\\nthe group on the rustic seat.\\n\\nThey were playing cherry-bob; and the child’s laughter made pleasant\\nmusic in the usually quiet place, while the man’s face lost its sad,\\nstern look, and was both gay and tender, as he held the little\\ncreature close, and popped the ripe fruit into the red, laughing\\nmouth.\\n\\nAs the last sweet morsel disappeared Rosy said, with a long breath\\nof perfect content,--\\n\\n“It’s ALMOST as good as having Papa to play with. I do hope the\\ncousins WILL let me come again! If they don’t, I think my heart will\\nbreak, ‘cause I get so homesick over there, and have so many trials,\\nand no one but Cousin Penny ever cuddles me.”\\n\\n“Bless her heart! We’ll send her some flowers for that. You tell her\\nthat Mrs. Dover is poorly, and would like very much to see her; and\\nso would Mr. Thomas, who enjoys her little niece immensely. Can you\\nremember that?”\\n\\n“Every word! SHE is very nice to me, and I love her, and I guess she\\nwill be glad to come. She likes MOSS-roses, and so do I,” added the\\nunblushing little beggar, as Mr. Dover took out his knife and began\\nto make the bouquet which was to be Miss Penny’s bribe. He could not\\nbear to give up his little playmate, and was quite ready to try\\nagain, with this persistent and charming ally to help him heal the\\nbreach.\\n\\n“Shall you send anything to Cis? You needn’t mind about it, ‘cause\\nshe can’t keep me at home, but it might please her, and make her\\nstop rapping my head with her thimble when I ask questions, and\\nslapping my fingers when I touch any of her pretty things,”\\n suggested Button, as the flowers were added to the fruit, making\\na fine display.\\n\\n“I never send presents to YOUNG ladies,” said Mr. Thomas shortly,\\nadding, with both hands out, and his most inviting smile, “But I\\nALWAYS kiss nice little girls if they will allow me?”\\n\\nButton threw both arms about his neck and gave him a shower of\\ngrateful kisses, which were sweeter to the lonely old man than all\\nthe cherries that ever grew, or the finest flowers in his garden.\\nThen Miss Rosamond proudly marched home, finding no trace of the\\nwatchers, for both had fled while the “cuddling” went on. Roxy was\\nsoberly setting the dinner-table, and Miss Henny in the parlor\\nbreathing hard behind a newspaper. Miss Penny and Cicely were\\nspending the day out, so the roses had to wait; but the basket was\\nmost graciously received, also the carefully delivered message, and\\nthe child’s heart was rejoiced by free permission to go and see “our\\nkind neighbor now and then, if Sister does not object.”\\n\\nRosy was in great spirits, and prattled away as they sat at dinner,\\nemboldened by the lady’s unusual amiability to ask all sorts of\\nquestions, some of which proved rather embarrassing to Miss Henny,\\nand very amusing to Roxy, listening in the china-closet.\\n\\n“I wish _I_ had ‘spepsia,” was the abrupt remark of the small person\\nas her plate of drum-sticks was removed and the pudding appeared,\\naccompanied by the cherries.\\n\\n“Why, dear?” asked Miss Henny, busily arranging the small dish of\\ndelicate tidbits, which left little but the skeleton of the roast\\nfowl for the kitchen.\\n\\n“Then I could have the nicest bits of chicken, and heaps of sauce on\\nmy pudding, and the butteryest slices of toast, and ALL the cream\\nfor my tea, as you do. It isn’t a VERY bad pain, is it?” asked Rosy,\\nin such perfect good faith that Miss Henny’s sudden flush and Roxy’s\\nhasty dive into the closet never suggested to her that this innocent\\nspeech was bringing the old lady’s besetting sin to light in the\\nmost open manner.\\n\\n“Yes, child, it is VERY bad, and you may thank your stars that I try\\nto keep you from it by feeding you on plain food. At my age, and\\nsuffering as I do, the best of everything is needed to keep up my\\nstrength,” said Miss Henny, tartly. But the largest plate of\\npudding, with “heaps of sauce,” went to the child this day, and when\\nthe fruit was served, an unusually small portion was put away for\\nthe invalid, who was obliged to sustain nature with frequent lunches\\nthrough the day and evening.\\n\\n“I’m s’prised that you suffer much, Cousin Henny. How brave you must\\nbe, not to cry about it, and go round in horrid pain, as you do, and\\ndress so nicely, and see people, and work ‘broidering, and make\\ncalls! I hope I shall be brave if I ever DO have ‘spepsia; but I\\nguess I shan’t, you take such care to give me small pieces every\\ntime.”\\n\\nWith which cheerful remark Rosy closed that part of the conversation\\nand returned to the delights of her new friend’s garden. But from\\nthat day, among other changes which began about this time, the\\nchild’s cup and plate were well filled, and the dread of adding to\\nher own sufferings seemed to curb the dyspeptic’s voracious\\nappetite. “A cheild was amang them takin’ notes,” and every one\\ninvoluntarily dreaded those clear eyes and that frank tongue, so\\ninnocently observing and criticising all that went on. Cicely had\\nalready been reminded of a neglected duty by Rosy’s reading to Miss\\nPenny, and tried to be more faithful in that, as in other services\\nwhich she owed the old lady. So the little missionary was evidently\\ngetting on, though quite unconscious of her work at home, so\\nabsorbed was she in her foreign mission; for, like many another\\nmissionary, the savage over the way was more interesting than the\\nselfish, slothful, or neglected souls at home.\\n\\nMiss Penny was charmed with her flowers and the friendly message\\nsent her, and to Rosy’s great delight went next day, in best bonnet\\nand gown, to make a call upon the old lady “who was poorly,” for\\nthat appeal could not be resisted. Rosy also, in honor of the great\\noccasion, wore HER best hat, and a white frock so stiff that she\\nlooked like a little opera dancer as the long black legs skipped\\nalong the street; for it was far too grand a visit to be paid\\nthrough a hole in the wall.\\n\\nIn the basket were certain delicacies for the old lady, and a card\\nhad been prepared, with the names of Miss Carey and Miss Rosamond\\nCarey beautifully written on it by Cis, who was dying to go, but\\ndared not after Rosy had told her Mr. Dover’s remark about young\\nladies.\\n\\nAs the procession of two paused at the door, both the young and the\\nold heart fluttered a little, for this was the first decided step\\ntoward reconciliation, and any check might spoil it all. The maid\\nstared, but civilly led these unexpected guests in and departed with\\nthe card. Miss Penny settled herself in a large chair and looked\\nabout with pensive interest at the familiar room. But Rosy made a\\nbee-line for the great tiger-skin, and regardless of her clean\\nfrock lay down on it to examine the head, which glared at her with\\nyellow eyes, showing all its sharp teeth in the most delightfully\\nnatural manner.\\n\\nMr. Dover came in with a formal bow, but Miss Penny put out both\\nhands, and said in her sweet old voice,--\\n\\n“Let us be friends again for the sake of your mother.”\\n\\nThat settled the matter at once, and Mr. Thomas was so eager to do\\nhis part that he not only shook the hands heartily, but kept them in\\nhis as he said like an honest man,--\\n\\n“My dear neighbor, I beg your pardon! _I_ was wrong, but I’m not too\\nproud to own it and say I’m glad to let by-gones be by-gones for the\\nsake of all. Now come and see my mother; she is longing for you.”\\n\\nWhat went on in the next room Rosy never knew or cared, for Mr.\\nThomas soon returned, and amused her so well, showing his treasures,\\nthat she forgot where she was till the maid came to say tea was\\nready.\\n\\n“Are we going to stay?” cried the little girl, beaming from under a\\nFeejee crown of feathers, which produced as comical an effect upon\\nher curly head as did the collar of shark’s teeth round her plump\\nneck or the great Japanese war-fan in her hand.\\n\\n“Yes, we have tea at five; come and turn it out. I’ve ordered the\\nlittle cups especially for you,” said her host, as he changed the\\nsmall Amazon to a pretty child again and led her away to preside at\\nthe table, where the quaint china and silver, and the dainty cake\\nand bread and butter proved much more attractive than the little old\\nlady in a big cap who patted her head and smiled at her.\\n\\nNever had Rosy enjoyed such a delicious meal; for the rapture of\\npouring real tea out of a pot shaped like a silver melon, into cups\\nas thin as egg-shells, and putting in sugar with tongs like claws,\\nnot to mention much thick cream, also spicy, plummy cakes that\\nmelted in one’s mouth, was too great for words.\\n\\nThe little maid was so absorbed in her new duties that she never\\nminded what the elders talked about, till the plates were empty, the\\npot ran dry, and no one could be prevailed on to have any more tea.\\nThen she leaned back in her chair and remarked with an air of calm\\nsatisfaction, as she looked from one to the other, and smiled that\\nengaging smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Isn’t being friends a great deal nicer than fighting and throwing\\ncats over walls and calling bad names?”\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh, and that cheerful sound seemed to\\ntune every one to the sweetest harmony, while the little peacemaker\\nwas passed round as if a last course of kisses was absolutely\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThen the party broke up, and Mr. Dover escorted his guests to their\\nown gate, to the great amazement of the neighbors and the very\\nvisible pride of Miss Button-Rose, who went up the walk with her\\nhead as high as if the wreath of daisies on her little hat had been\\na conqueror’s crown.\\n\\nNow that the first step had been taken, all would have gone smoothly\\nif Cicely, offended because Mr. Thomas took no notice of HER, had\\nnot put it into Miss Henny’s head that as the original quarrel began\\nbetween her and their neighbor, it would not be dignified to give in\\ntill Mr. Dover had come and begged pardon of HER as well as of Miss\\nPenny. This suited the foolish old lady, who never could forget\\ncertain plain words spoken in the heat of battle, though the kindly\\nones lately heard had much softened her heart toward the offender.\\n\\n“No, I shall not forget my dignity nor humble myself by going over\\nthere to apologize as Penelope has. SHE can do as she likes; and now\\nthat he has asked to be forgiven, there is perhaps no harm in HER\\nseeing the old lady. But with me it is different. _I_ was insulted,\\nand till Thomas Dover comes here and solemnly asks my pardon I will\\nNOT cross his threshold, no matter what bribes he sends,” said Miss\\nHenny, with an air of heroic firmness.\\n\\nBut it did cost her a pang when her sister went every now and then\\nto take tea with the old lady and came home full of pleasant news;\\nwhile Rosy prattled of the fine things she saw, the nice things she\\nhad to eat, and never failed to bring some gift to share, or to\\ndisplay to the exiles from Paradise. They ate the “bribes,” however,\\nas they called the fruit, admired the pretty trinkets and toys, and\\nlonged to share in the mild festivities of the pleasant house over\\nthe way, but stood firm in spite of all Rosy’s wiles, till something\\nunexpected happened to touch their hearts, conquer their foolish\\npride, and crown the little peacemaker’s efforts with success.\\n\\nOne August afternoon Cicely was discontentedly looking over her\\nsmall store of ornaments as she made ready for a party. She loved\\ngayety, and went about a great deal, leaving many duties undone, or\\nasking the little girl to attend to them for her, neglecting,\\nhowever, to show any gratitude for these small services so\\ncheerfully done.\\n\\nAs she sat tossing over her boxes, Button-Rose came in looking\\ntired and listless, for it was a hot day, and she had been out twice\\nto do errands for Cicely, besides trotting busily up and down to\\nwait on the old ladies while the young one put fresh ribbons on her\\ndress and curled her hair for the evening.\\n\\n“Could I lie on your sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and my legs\\nare SO tired,” said little Button, when her tap had been answered by\\na sharp “What do you want, child?”\\n\\n“No, I’m going to lie there myself and have a nap as soon as I’m\\ndone here. It’s cooler than the bed, and I must be fresh for\\nto-night,” said Cicely, too intent on her own affairs to see how\\nused up Rosy looked.\\n\\n“Then could I look at your pretty things if I don’t touch ‘em?”\\n asked the child, longing to peep into the interesting boxes\\nscattered on the table.\\n\\n“No, you can’t! I’m busy, and don’t want you asking questions and\\nmeddling. Go away and let me alone.”\\n\\nCicely spoke crossly, and waved her hand with a warning gesture,\\nthereby upsetting the tray which held the beads of the necklace she\\nhad decided to wear for want of something better.\\n\\n“There, now see what you’ve done! Pick up every one, and be quick,\\nfor I’m in a hurry.”\\n\\n“But I didn’t touch ‘em,” began poor Button, as she crept about\\nhunting for the black and white beads that looked like very ugly\\nmarbles.\\n\\n“Don’t talk; pick them up and then scamper; you are always in\\nmischief!” scolded Cis, vexed with herself, and the heat, and the\\naccident, and the whole world just then.\\n\\nRosy said no more, but several great tears dropped on the carpet as\\nshe groped in corners, under the bed, and behind the chairs for the\\nrun-aways; and when the last was found she put it in her tyrant’s\\nhand, saying, with a wistful look,--\\n\\n“I’m very sorry I troubled you. Seems to me if _I_ had a little\\ncousin, I’d love to have her play with my things, and I wouldn’t be\\ncross to her. Now I’ll go and try to AMOOSE myself with Bella; SHE\\nis always good to me.”\\n\\n“Run along then. Thank goodness that doll came when it did, for I’m\\ntired of ‘amoosing’ small girls as well as old ladies,” said Cis,\\nbusy with her beads, yet sorry she had been so petulant with patient\\nlittle Button, who seldom reproached her, being a cheery child, and\\nblessed with a sweet temper.\\n\\nRosy felt too languid to play; so when she had told Bella, the\\nLondon doll, her trials, and comforted herself with some kisses on\\nthe waxen cheeks, she roamed away to the summer-house, which was\\ncool and quiet, longing for some one to caress her; for the little\\nheart was homesick and the little head ached badly.\\n\\nThe “button-hole” had been made, the alley swept out, to the great\\ndismay of the spiders, earwigs, and toads, who had fled to quieter\\nquarters, and Rosy had leave to go and come when she liked if Mr.\\nDover did not object. He never did; and it was her greatest delight\\nto walk in the pretty garden at her own sweet will, always with the\\nhope of meeting its kindly owner, for now they were firm friends.\\nShe had been too busy for a run there that day; and now, as she\\npeeped in, it looked so shady and inviting, and it seemed so natural\\nto turn to her dear “missionary man” for entertainment, that she\\nwent straight up to his study window and peeped in.\\n\\nHe too seemed out of sorts that hot afternoon, for he sat leaning\\nhis head on both hands at the desk strewn with piles of old letters.\\nButton-Rose’s tender heart yearned over him at once, and stepping\\nquietly in at the long open window she went to him, saying in her\\ntenderest tone,--\\n\\n“Does your head ache, sir? Let me soft it as I do Papa’s; he says\\nthat always makes it more better. Please let me? I’d love to\\ndearly.”\\n\\n“Ah, my darling, I wish you could. But the pain is in my heart, and\\nnothing will ever cure it,” sighed Mr. Thomas, as he drew her close\\nand put his wrinkled yellow cheek to her soft one, which looked more\\nlike a damask rose than usual.\\n\\n“You have trials too, I s’pose. Mine trouble me to-day, so I came\\nover to see you. Shall I go away?” asked Rosy with a sigh and the\\nwistful look again.\\n\\n“No, stay, and we will comfort each other. Tell me your troubles,\\nButton, and perhaps I can help them,” the kind old gentleman said as\\nhe took her on his knee and stroked the curly head with a paternal\\ntouch.\\n\\nSo Rosy told her latest grief, and never saw the smile that crept\\nabout the lips that asked in a tone of deep interest,--\\n\\n“Well, what do you mean to do to that unkind Cicely?”\\n\\n“For a minute I wanted to slap her back when she tried to spat my\\nhands. Then I ‘membered that Mamma said a kiss for a blow was a good\\nthing, so I picked up the beads and planned to do it; but Cis looked\\nSO cross I couldn’t. If I had a pretty necklace I’d go and give it\\nto her, and then maybe she’d love me better.”\\n\\n“My dear little missionary, you SHALL have beads to win the heart of\\nYOUR heathen, if that is all you need. See here; take anything you\\nlike, and give it with the kiss.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover pulled open a drawer in the desk and\\ndisplayed a delightful collection of pretty, quaint, and curious\\ntrinkets picked up in foreign lands, and kept for keepsakes, since\\nno little daughters of his own lived to wear them.\\n\\n“How perf’ly dorgeous!” cried Rosy, who often fell into baby talk\\nwhen excited; and plunging in her hands, she revelled for some\\nminutes in sandal-wood cases, carved ivory fans, silver bangles,\\nbarbaric brooches, and necklaces of coral, shells, amber, and golden\\ncoins, that jingled musically.\\n\\n“What SHALL I take for her?” cried the little maid, bewildered by\\nsuch a mine of wealth. “You pick out one, Mr. Thomas, that will\\nplease her so much, ‘cause you never send her anything, and she\\ndon’t like it,” said Rosy, fearing that her own taste was not to be\\ntrusted, as she liked the shells and shark’s teeth ornaments best.\\n\\n“No, I’ll give YOU one, and you shall do as you like about giving it\\nto her. This, now, is really valuable and pretty, and any young lady\\nwould like to wear it. It makes me think of you, my Button, for it\\nis like sunshine, and the word cut on the little heart means peace.”\\n\\nMr. Dover held up a string of amber beads with its carved amulet,\\nand swung it to and fro where the light shone through it till each\\nbead looked like a drop of golden wine.\\n\\n“Yes, that is lovely, and it smells nice, too. She will be so\\ns’prised and pleased; I’ll go and take it to her right away,” cried\\nRosy, forgetting to ask anything for herself, in her delight at this\\nfine gift for Cis.\\n\\nBut as she lifted her head after he had fastened the clasp about her\\nneck, something in his face recalled the look it wore when she first\\ncame in, and putting both hands upon his shoulders, she said in her\\nsweet little way,--\\n\\n“You’ve made my troubles go away, can’t I make yours? You are SO\\nkind to me, I’d love to help you if I could.”\\n\\n“You do, my child, more than you know; for when I get you in my arms\\nit seems as if one of my poor babies had come back to me, and for a\\nminute I forget the three little graves far away in India.”\\n\\n“Three!” cried Button, like a sad, soft echo; and she clung to the\\npoor man as if trying to fill the empty arms with the love and pity\\nthat over-flowed the childish soul in her small body.\\n\\nThis was the comfort Mr. Thomas wanted, and for a few moments he\\njust cradled her on his hungry heart, crooning a Hindostanee\\nlullaby, while a few slow tears came dropping down upon the yellow\\nhead, so like those hidden for years under the Indian flowers.\\nPresently he seemed to come back from the happy past to which the\\nold letters had carried him. He wiped his eyes, and Rosy’s also,\\nwith the big purple silk handkerchief, and pressing some very\\ngrateful kisses on the hot cheeks, said cheerfully again,--\\n\\n“God bless you, child, that’s done me good! But don’t let it sadden\\nyou, dear; forget all about it, and tell no one what a sentimental\\nold fool I am.”\\n\\n“I never truly will! Only when you feel sorry about the poor little\\nbabies, let me come and give you cuddlings. They always make people\\nfeel more better, and I love ‘em, and don’t get any now my dear\\npeople are away.”\\n\\nSo the two made a tender little plan to comfort each other when\\nhearts were heavy with longings for the absent, and parted at the\\nsmall gate, both much cheered, and faster friends than ever.\\n\\nRosy hastened in with her peace-offering, forgetful now of headache\\nor loneliness as she sat patiently in the wide entry window-seat\\nlistening till some sound in Cicely’s room should show that she was\\nawake. Before that happened, however, poor Button fell asleep\\nherself, lulled by the quiet of the house,--for every one was\\nnapping,--and dreamed that Mr. Dover stood waving a rainbow over\\nhis head, while several Indian gods and three little girls were\\ndancing round him, hand in hand, to the tune of “Ring around a\\nrosy.”\\n\\nA loud yawn roused her, and there was Cis peeping out of her door to\\nsee what time it was by the old-fashioned clock on the landing. Up\\nscrambled the child, feeling dizzy and heavy-eyed, but so eager to\\ngive pleasure that she lost no time in saying, as she swung the\\nnecklace in the sunshine,--\\n\\n“See! this is for you, if you like it more better than the\\nthunder-and-lightning marbles, as Cousin Penny calls the one you\\nwere going to wear.”\\n\\n“How lovely! Where DID you get it, child?” cried Cis, wide awake at\\nonce, as she ran to the glass to try the effect of the new ornament\\non her white neck.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Thomas gave it to me; but he said I could give it away\\nif I liked, and I want you to have it, ‘cause it’s ever so much\\nprettier than any you’ve got.”\\n\\n“That’s very kind of you, Chicken, but why not keep it yourself? You\\nlike nice things as well as I do,” said Cicely, much impressed by\\nthe value of the gift, for it was real amber, and the clasp of gold.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve talked with Mr. Thomas about missionarying a great deal,\\nand he told me how he made the savinges good by giving them beads,\\nand things to eat, and being patient and kind to them. So I thought\\nI’d play be a missionary, and call this house Africa, and try to\\nmake the people here behave more better,” answered Rosy, with such\\nengaging earnestness, as well as frankness, that Cis laughed, and\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“You impertinent monkey, to call us heathen and try to convert us!\\nHow do you expect to do it?”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m getting on pretty well, only you don’t CONVERT as quick as\\nsome of the savinges did. I’ll tell you about it;” and Button went\\non eagerly. “Cousin Penny is the good old one, but rather fussy and\\nslow, so I’m kind and patient, and now she loves me and lets me do\\nthings I like. She is my best one. Cousin Henny is my cannybel,\\n‘cause she eats so much, and I please HER by bringing nice things\\nand getting her cushions ready. You are my baddest one, who is cross\\nto me, and fights, and raps my head, and slaps my hands; so I\\nthought some beads would be nice for you, and I bringed these\\nbeauties. Mr. Thomas gave ‘em to me when I told him my trials.”\\n\\nCicely looked angry, amused, and ashamed, as she listened to the\\nfunny yet rather pathetic little play with which the lonely child\\nhad tried to cheer herself and win the hearts of those about her.\\nShe had the grace to blush, and offer back the necklace, saying in a\\nself-reproachful tone,--\\n\\n“Keep your beads, little missionary, I’ll be converted without them,\\nand try to be kinder to you. I AM a selfish wretch, but you shall\\nplay be my little sister, and not have to go to strangers for\\ncomfort in your trials any more. Come, kiss me, dear, and we’ll\\nbegin now.”\\n\\nRosy was in her arms at once, and clung there, saying with a face\\nall smiles,--\\n\\n“That’s what I wanted! I thought I’d make a good savinge of you if I\\ntried VERY hard. Please be kind to me just till Mamma comes back,\\nand I’ll be the best little sister that ever was.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you tell me all about it before?” asked Cicely,\\nsmoothing the tired head on her shoulder with a new gentleness; for\\nthis last innocent confession had touched her heart as well as her\\nconscience.\\n\\n“You never seemed to care about my plays, and always said, ‘Don’t\\nchatter, child; run away and take care of yourself.’ So I did; but\\nit was pretty dull, with only Tabby to tell secrets to and Bella to\\nkiss. Mr. Thomas said people over here didn’t like children very\\nwell, and I found they didn’t. HE does, dearly, so I went to him;\\nbut I like you now, you are so soft and kind to me.”\\n\\n“How hot your cheeks are! Come and let me cool them, and brush your\\nhair for tea,” said Cis, as she touched the child’s feverish skin,\\nand saw how heavy her eyes were.\\n\\n“I’m all burning up, and my head is SO funny. I don’t want any tea.\\nI want to lie on your sofa and go to sleep again. Can I?” asked\\nRosy, with a dizzy look about the room, and a shiver at the idea of\\neating.\\n\\n“Yes, dear, I’ll put on your little wrapper, and make you all\\ncomfortable, and bring you some ice-water, for your lips are very\\ndry.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Cicely bustled about the room, and soon had Rosy\\nnicely settled with her best cologne-bottle and a fan; then she\\nhastened down to report that something was wrong, with a fear in her\\nown heart that if any harm did come to the child it would be her\\nfault. Some days before Cicely had sent Button-Rose with a note to a\\nfriend’s house where she knew some of the younger children were ill.\\nSince then she had heard that it was scarlet fever; but though Rosy\\nhad waited some time for an answer to the note, and seen one of the\\ninvalids, Cis had never mentioned the fact, being ashamed to confess\\nher carelessness, hoping no harm was done. Now she felt that it HAD\\ncome, and went to tell gentle Cousin Penny with tears of vain\\nregret.\\n\\nGreat was the lamentation when the doctor, who was sent for in hot\\nhaste, pronounced it scarlet fever; and deep was the self-reproach\\nof the two older women for their blindness in not before remarking\\nthe languid air and want of appetite in the child. But Cicely was\\nfull of remorse; for every quick word, every rap of the hateful\\nthimble, every service accepted without thanks, weighed heavily on\\nher conscience now, as such things have an inconvenient way of doing\\nwhen it is too late to undo them. Every one was devoted to the\\nchild, even lazy Miss Henny gave up her naps to sit by her at all\\nhours, Miss Penny hovered over the little bed like a grandmother,\\nand Cicely refused to think of pleasure till the danger was over.\\n\\nFor soon Button-Rose was very ill, and the old house haunted by the\\ndreadful fear that death would rob them of the little creature who\\ngrew so precious when the thought of losing her made their hearts\\nstand still. How could they live without the sound of that sweet\\nvoice chirping about the house, the busy feet tripping up and down,\\nthe willing hands trying to help, the sunny face smiling at every\\none, and going away into corners to hide the tears that sometimes\\ncame to dim its brightness? What would comfort the absent mother for\\nsuch a loss as this, and how could they answer to the father for the\\ncarelessness that risked the child’s life for a girl’s errand? No\\none dared to think, and all prayed heartily for Rosy’s life, as they\\nwatched and waited by the little bed where she lay so patiently,\\ntill the fever grew high and she began to babble about many things.\\nHer childish trials were all told, her longings for Mamma, whose\\nplace no one could fill, her quaint little criticisms upon those\\nabout her, and her plans for making peace. These innocent\\nrevelations caused many tears, and wrought some changes in those who\\nheard; for Miss Penny quite forgot her infirmities to live in the\\nsick-room as the most experienced nurse and tenderest watcher. Miss\\nHenny cooked her daintiest gruel, brewed her coolest drinks, and\\nlost many pounds in weight by her indefatigable trotting up and down\\nto minister to the invalid’s least caprice. Cicely was kept away for\\nfear of infection, but HER penance was to wander about the great\\nhouse, more silent than ever now, to answer the inquiries and listen\\nto the sad forebodings of the neighbors, who came to offer help and\\nsympathy; for all loved little Button-Rose, and grieved to think of\\nany blight falling on the pretty blossom. To wile away the long\\nhours, Cicely fell to dusting the empty rooms, setting closets and\\ndrawers to rights, and keeping all fresh and clean, to the great\\nrelief of the old cousins, who felt that everything would go to\\ndestruction in their absence. She read and sewed now, having no\\nheart for jaunting about; and as she made the long neglected white\\npinafores, for Rosy, she thought much of the little girl who might\\nnever live to wear them.\\n\\nMeantime the fever took its course, and came at last to the fateful\\nday when a few hours would settle the question of life or death. The\\nhot flush died out of the cheeks that had lost their soft roundness\\nnow, the lips were parched, the half-shut eyes looked like sick\\nviolets, and all the pretty curls were tangled on the pillow. Rosy\\nno longer sung to Bella, talked of “three dear little girls” and Mr.\\nThomas, tigers and bangles, Cis and necklaces, hens and gates. She\\nceased to call for Mamma, asked no more why her “missionary man”\\n never came, and took no notice of the anxious old faces bending over\\nher. She lay in a stupor, and the doctor held the little wasted\\nhand, and tried to see the face of his watch with dim eyes as he\\ncounted the faint pulse, whispering solemnly,--\\n\\n“We can only hope and wait now. Sleep alone can save her.”\\n\\nAs the sisters sat, one on either side the narrow bed that day, and\\nCicely walked restlessly up and down the long hall below, where both\\ndoors stood open to let in the cool evening air, as the sun went\\ndown, a quick but quiet step came up the steps, and Mr. Dover walked\\nin without ringing. He had been away, and coming home an hour ago,\\nheard the sad news. Losing not a moment, he hurried to ask about his\\nlittle Button, and his face showed how great his love and fear were,\\nas he said in a broken whisper,--\\n\\n“Will she live? My mother never told me how serious it was, or I\\nshould have returned at once.”\\n\\n“We hope so, sir, but--” And there Cicely’s voice failed, as she hid\\nher face and sobbed.\\n\\n“My dear girl, don’t give way. Keep up your heart, hope, pray, will\\nthat the darling SHALL live, and that may do some good. We can’t let\\nher go! we won’t let her go! Let me see her; I know much of fevers\\nfar worse than this, and might be able to suggest something,” begged\\nMr. Dover, throwing down his hat, and waving an immense fan with\\nsuch an air of resolution and cheery good-will that tired Cis felt\\ncomforted at once, and led the way upstairs entirely forgetting the\\ngreat feud, as he did.\\n\\nAt the threshold of the door he paused, till the girl had whispered\\nhis name. Miss Penny, always a gentlewoman, rose at once and went\\nto meet him, but Miss Henny did not even seem to see him, for just\\nthen, as if dimly feeling that her friend was near, Rosy stirred,\\nand gave a long sigh.\\n\\nSilently the three stood and looked at the beloved little creature\\nlying there in the mysterious shadow of death, and they so helpless\\nto keep her if the hour for departure had come.\\n\\n“God help us!” sighed pious Miss Penny, folding her old hands, as if\\nthey did that often now.\\n\\n“Drifting away, I fear;” and Miss Henny’s plump face looked almost\\nbeautiful, with the tears on it, as she leaned nearer to listen to\\nthe faint breath at the child’s lips.\\n\\n“No; we will keep her, please the Lord! If we can make her sleep\\nquietly for the next few hours she is safe. Let me try. Fan slowly\\nwith this, Miss Henrietta, and you, dear lady, pray that the\\nprecious little life may be given us.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover gave the great fan to Miss Henny, took the\\nsmall cold hands in his, and sitting on the bedside held them close\\nin his large warm ones, as if trying to pour life and strength into\\nthe frail body, as his eyes, fixed on the half-opened ones, seemed\\nto call back the innocent soul hovering on the threshold of its\\nprison, like the butterfly poised upon the chrysalis before it soars\\naway.\\n\\nMiss Penny knelt down near by, and laying her white head on the\\nother pillow, again besought God to spare this treasure to the\\nfather and mother over the sea. How long they remained so none of\\nthem ever knew, silent and motionless but for the slow waving of the\\nnoiseless fan, which went to and fro like the wing of a great white\\nbird, as if Miss Henny’s stout arm could never tire. Miss Penny was\\nso still she seemed to be asleep. Mr. Dover never stirred, but grew\\npaler as the minutes passed; and Cicely, creeping now and then to\\nlook in and steal away, saw strange power in the black eyes that\\nseemed to hold the fluttering spirit of the little child by the love\\nand longing that made them both tender and commanding.\\n\\nA level ray of sunlight stole through the curtain at last and turned\\nthe tangles of bright hair to pure gold. Miss Henny rose to shut it\\nout, and as if her movement broke the spell, Rosy took a long full\\nbreath, turned on the pillow, and putting one hand under her cheek,\\nseemed to fall asleep as naturally as she used to do when well. Miss\\nPenny looked up, touched the child’s forehead, and whispered, with a\\nlook of gratitude as bright as if the sunshine had touched her\\nalso,--\\n\\n“It is moist! this is real sleep! Oh, my baby! oh, my baby!” And the\\nold head went down again with a stifled sob, for her experienced eye\\ntold her that the danger was passing by and Rosy would live.\\n\\n“The prayers of the righteous avail much,” murmured Mr. Dover,\\nturning to the other lady, who stood beside her sister looking down\\nat the little figure now lying so restfully between them.\\n\\n“How can we thank you?” she whispered, offering her hand, with the\\nsmile which had once made her pretty, and still touched the old face\\nwith something better than beauty.\\n\\nMr. Dover took the hand and answered, with an eloquent look at the\\nchild,--\\n\\n“Let not the sun go down upon our wrath. Forgive me and be friends\\nagain, for her sake.”\\n\\n“I will!” And the plump hands gave the thin ones a hearty shake as\\nthe great feud ended forever over the bed of the little peacemaker\\nwhose childish play had turned to happy earnest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR\\n\\n\\n“Here’s your breakfast, miss. I hope it’s right. Your mother showed\\nme how to fix it, and said I’d find a cup up here.”\\n\\n“Take that blue one. I have not much appetite, and can’t eat if\\nthings are not nice and pretty. I like the flowers. I’ve been\\nlonging for some ever since I saw them last night.”\\n\\nThe first speaker was a red-haired, freckle-faced girl, in a brown\\ncalico dress and white apron, with a tray in her hands and an air of\\ntimid hospitality in her manner; the second a pale, pretty creature,\\nin a white wrapper and blue net, sitting in a large chair, looking\\nabout her with the languid interest of an invalid in a new place.\\nHer eyes brightened as they fell upon a glass of rosy laurel and\\ndelicate maidenhair fern that stood among the toast and eggs,\\nstrawberries and cream, on the tray.\\n\\n“Our laurel is jest in blow, and I’m real glad you come in time to\\nsee it. I’ll bring you a lot, as soon’s ever I get time to go for\\nit.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, the plain girl replaced the ugly crockery cup and\\nsaucer with the pretty china ones pointed out to her, arranged the\\ndishes, and waited to see if anything else was needed.\\n\\n“What is your name, please?” asked the pretty girl, refreshing\\nherself with a draught of new milk.\\n\\n“Rebecca. Mother thought I’d better wait on you; the little girls\\nare so noisy and apt to forget. Wouldn’t you like a piller to your\\nback? you look so kind of feeble seems as if you wanted to be\\npropped up a mite.”\\n\\nThere was so much compassion and good-will in the face and voice,\\nthat Emily accepted the offer, and let Rebecca arrange a cushion\\nbehind her; then, while the one ate daintily, and the other stirred\\nabout an inner room, the talk went on,--for two girls are seldom\\nlong silent when together.\\n\\n“I think the air is going to suit me, for I slept all night and\\nnever woke till Mamma had been up ever so long and got things all\\nnicely settled,” said Emily, graciously, when the fresh strawberries\\nhad been enjoyed, and the bread and butter began to vanish.\\n\\n“I’m real glad you like it; most folks do, if they don’t mind it\\nbeing plain and quiet up here. It’s gayer down at the hotel, but the\\nair ain’t half so good, and delicate folks generally like our old\\nplace best,” answered Becky, as she tossed over a mattress and shook\\nout the sheet with a brisk, capable air pleasant to see.\\n\\n“I wanted to go to the hotel, but the doctor said it would be too\\nnoisy for me, so Mamma was glad to find rooms here. I didn’t think a\\nfarm-house COULD be so pleasant. That view is perfectly splendid!”\\n and Emily sat up to gaze delightedly out of the window, below which\\nspread the wide intervale, through which the river ran with\\nhay-fields on either side, while along the green slopes of the hills\\nlay farm-houses with garden plots, and big barns waiting for the\\nharvest; and beyond, the rocky, wooded pastures dotted with cattle\\nand musical with cow-bells, brooks, and birds.\\n\\nA balmy wind kissed a little color into the pale cheeks, the\\nlistless eyes brightened as they looked, and the fretful lines\\nvanished from lips that smiled involuntarily at the sweet welcome\\nNature gave the city child come to rest and play and grow gay and\\nrosy in her green lap.\\n\\nBecky watched her with interest, and was glad to see how soon the\\nnew-comer felt the charm of the place, for the girl loved her\\nmountain home, and thought the old farm-house the loveliest spot in\\nthe world.\\n\\n“When you get stronger I can show you lots of nice views round here.\\nThere’s a woodsy place behind the house that’s just lovely. Down by\\nthe laurel bushes is MY favorite spot, and among the rocks is a cave\\nwhere I keep things handy when I get a resting-spell now and then,\\nand want to be quiet. Can’t get much at home, when there’s boarders\\nand five children round in vacation time.”\\n\\nBecky laughed as she spoke, and there was a sweet motherly look in\\nher plain face, as she glanced at the three little red heads bobbing\\nabout the door-yard below, where hens cackled, a pet lamb fed, and\\nthe old white dog lay blinking in the sun.\\n\\n“I like children; we have none at home, and Mamma makes such a baby\\nof me I’m almost ashamed sometimes. I want her to have a good rest\\nnow, for she has taken care of me all winter and needs it. You shall\\nbe my nurse, if I need one; but I hope to be so well soon that I can\\nsee to myself. It’s so tiresome to be ill!” and Emily sighed as she\\nleaned back among her pillows, with a glance at the little glass\\nwhich showed her a thin face and shorn head.\\n\\n“It must be! I never was sick, but I have taken care of sick folks,\\nand have a sight of sympathy for ‘em. Mother says I make a pretty\\ngood nurse, being strong and quiet,” answered Becky, plumping up\\npillows and folding towels with a gentle despatch which was very\\ngrateful to the invalid, who had dreaded a noisy, awkward\\nserving-maid.\\n\\n“Never ill! how nice that must be! I’m always having colds and\\nheadaches, and fusses of some kind. What do you do to keep well,\\nRebecca?” asked Emily, watching her with interest, as she came in to\\nremove the tray.\\n\\n“Nothing but work; I haven’t time to be sick, and when I’m tuckered\\nout, I go and rest over yonder. Then I’m all right, and buckle to\\nagain, as smart as ever;” and every freckle in Becky’s rosy face\\nseemed to shine with cheerful strength and courage.\\n\\n“I’m ‘tuckered out’ doing nothing,” said Emily, amused with the new\\nexpression, and eager to try a remedy which showed such fine results\\nin this case. “I shall visit your pet places and do a little work as\\nsoon as I am able, and see if it won’t set me up. Now I can only\\ndawdle, doze, and read a little. Will you please put those books\\nhere on the table? I shall want them by-and-by.”\\n\\nEmily pointed to a pile of blue and gold volumes lying on a trunk,\\nand Becky dusted her hands as she took them up with an air of\\nreverence, for she read on the backs of the volumes names which made\\nher eyes sparkle.\\n\\n“Do you care for poetry?” asked Emily, surprised at the girl’s look\\nand manner.\\n\\n“Guess I do! don’t get much except the pieces I cut out of papers,\\nbut I love ‘em, and stick ‘em in an old ledger, and keep it down in\\nmy cubby among the rocks. I do love THAT man’s pieces. They seem to\\ngo right to the spot somehow;” and Becky smiled at the name of\\nWhittier as if the sweetest of our poets was a dear old friend of\\nhers.\\n\\n“I like Tennyson better. Do you know him?” asked Emily, with a\\nsuperior air, for the idea of this farmer’s daughter knowing\\nanything about poetry amused her.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve got a number of his pieces in my book, and I’m fond of\\n‘em. But this man makes things so kind of true and natural I feel at\\nhome with HIM. And this one I’ve longed to read, though I guess I\\ncan’t understand much of it. His ‘Bumble Bee’ was just lovely; with\\nthe grass and columbines and the yellow breeches of the bee. I’m\\nnever tired of that;” and Becky’s face woke up into something like\\nbeauty as she glanced hungrily at the Emerson while she dusted the\\ndelicate cover that hid the treasures she coveted.\\n\\n“I don’t care much for him, but Mamma does. I like romantic poems,\\nand ballads, and songs; don’t like descriptions of clouds and\\nfields, and bees, and farmers,” said Emily, showing plainly that\\neven Emerson’s simplest poems were far above her comprehension as\\nyet, because she loved sentiment more than Nature.\\n\\n“I do, because I know ‘em better than love and the romantic stuff\\nmost poetry tells about. But I don’t pretend to judge, I’m glad of\\nanything I can get. Now if you don’t want me I’ll pick up my dishes\\nand go to work.”\\n\\nWith that Becky went away, leaving Emily to rest and dream with her\\neyes on the landscape which was giving her better poetry than any\\nher books held. She told her mother about the odd girl, and was sure\\nshe would be amusing if she did not forget her place and try to be\\nfriends.\\n\\n“She is a good creature, my dear, her mother’s main stay, and works\\nbeyond her strength, I am sure. Be kind to the poor girl, and put a\\nlittle pleasure into her life if you can,” answered Mrs. Spenser, as\\nshe moved about, settling comforts and luxuries for her invalid.\\n\\n“I shall HAVE to talk to her, as there is no other person of my age\\nin the house. How are the school marms? shall you get on with them,\\nMamma? It will be so lonely here for us both, if we don’t make\\nfriends with some one.”\\n\\n“Most intelligent and amiable women all three, and we shall have\\npleasant times together, I am sure. You may safely cultivate Becky;\\nMrs. Taylor told me she was a remarkably bright girl, though she may\\nnot look it.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see. But I do hate freckles and big red hands, and round\\nshoulders. She can’t help it, I suppose, but ugly things fret me.”\\n\\n“Remember that she has no time to be pretty, and be glad she is so\\nneat and willing. Shall we read, dear? I’m ready now.”\\n\\nEmily consented, and listened for an hour or two while the pleasant\\nvoice beside her conjured away all her vapors with some of Mrs.\\nEwing’s charming tales.\\n\\n“The grass is dry now, and I want to stroll on that green lawn\\nbefore lunch. You rest, Mamma dear, and let me make discoveries all\\nalone,” proposed Emily, when the sun shone warmly, and the instinct\\nof all young creatures for air and motion called her out.\\n\\nSo, with her hat and wrap, and book and parasol, she set forth to\\nexplore the new land in which she found herself.\\n\\nDown the wide, creaking stairs and out upon the door-stone she went,\\npausing there for a moment to decide where first to go. The sound of\\nsome one singing in the rear of the house led her in that direction,\\nand turning the corner she made her first pleasant discovery. A hill\\nrose steeply behind the farm-house, and leaning from the bank was an\\nold apple-tree, shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks\\nand dropped into a mossy trough below. Up the tree had grown a wild\\ngrape-vine, making a green canopy over the great log which served as\\na seat, and some one had planted maidenhair ferns about both seat\\nand spring to flourish beautifully in the damp, shady spot.\\n\\n“Oh, how pretty! I’ll go and sit there. It looks clean, and I can\\nsee what is going on in that big kitchen, and hear the singing. I\\nsuppose it’s Becky’s little sisters by the racket.”\\n\\nEmily established herself on the lichen-covered log with her feet\\nupon a stone, and sat enjoying the musical tinkle of the water, with\\nher eyes on the delicate ferns stirring in the wind, and the lively\\njingle of the multiplication-table chanted by childish voices in her\\near.\\n\\nPresently two little girls with a great pan of beans came to do\\ntheir work on the back doorstep, a third was seen washing dishes at\\na window, and Becky’s brown-spotted gown flew about the kitchen as\\nif a very energetic girl wore it. A woman’s voice was heard giving\\ndirections, as the speaker was evidently picking chickens somewhere\\nout of sight.\\n\\nA little of the talk reached Emily and both amused and annoyed her,\\nfor it proved that the country people were not as stupid as they\\nlooked.\\n\\n“Oh, well, we mustn’t mind if she IS notional and kind of wearing;\\nshe’s been sick, and it will take time to get rid of her fretty\\nways. Jest be pleasant, and take no notice, and that nice mother of\\nhers will make it all right,” said the woman’s voice.\\n\\n“How anybody with every mortal thing to be happy with CAN be\\nout-of-sorts passes me. She fussed about every piller, chair, trunk,\\nand mite of food last night, and kept that poor tired lady trotting\\ntill I was provoked. She’s right pleasant this morning though, and\\nas pretty as a picture in her ruffled gown and that blue thing on\\nher head,” answered Becky from the pantry, as she rattled out the\\npie-board, little dreaming who sat hidden behind the grape-vine\\nfestoons that veiled the corner by the spring.\\n\\n“Well, she’s got redder hair ‘n’ we have, so she needn’t be so grand\\nand try to hide it with blue nets,” added one little voice.\\n\\n“Yes, and it’s ever so much shorter ‘n’ ours, and curls all over her\\nhead like Daisy’s wool. I should think such a big girl would feel\\nreal ashamed without no braids,” said the other child, proudly\\nsurveying the tawny mane that hung over her shoulders,--for like\\nmost red-haired people all the children were blessed with luxuriant\\ncrops of every shade from golden auburn to regular carrots.\\n\\n“I think it’s lovely. Suppose it had to be cut off when she had the\\nfever. Wish I could get rid of my mop, it’s such a bother;” and\\nBecky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that made her\\nhead look very like a copper kettle.\\n\\n“Now fly round, deary, and get them pies ready. I’ll have these\\nfowls on in a minute, and then go to my butter. You run off and see\\nif you can’t find some wild strawberries for the poor girl, soon’s\\never you are through with them beans, children. We must kind of\\npamper her up for a spell till her appetite comes back,” said the\\nmother.\\n\\nHere the chat ended, and soon the little girls were gone, leaving\\nBecky alone rolling out pie-crust before the pantry window. As she\\nworked her lips moved, and Emily, still peeping through the leaves,\\nwondered what she was saying, for a low murmur rose and fell,\\nemphasized now and then with a thump of the rolling-pin.\\n\\n“I mean to go and find out. If I stand on that wash-bench I can look\\nin and see her work. I’ll show them all that _I_‘m NOT ‘fussy,’ and\\ncan be ‘right pleasant’ if I like.”\\n\\nWith this wise resolution Emily went down the little path, and after\\npausing to examine the churn set out to dry, and the row of pans\\nshining on a neighboring shelf, made her way to the window, mounted\\nthe bench while Becky’s back was turned, and pushing away the\\nmorning-glory vines and scarlet beans that ran up on either side\\npeeped in with such a smiling face that the crossest cook could not\\nhave frowned on her as an intruder.\\n\\n“May I see you work? I can’t eat pies, but I like to watch people\\nmake them. Do you mind?”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I’d ask you to come in, but it’s dreadful hot here, and\\nnot much room,” answered Becky, crimping round the pastry before she\\npoured in the custard. “I’m going to make a nice little pudding for\\nyou; your mother said you liked ‘em; or would you rather have\\nwhipped cream with a mite of jelly in it?” asked Becky, anxious to\\nsuit her new boarder.\\n\\n“Whichever is easiest to make. I don’t care what I eat. Do tell me\\nwhat you were saying. It sounded like poetry,” said Emily, leaning\\nboth elbows on the wide ledge with a pale pink morning-glory kissing\\nher cheek, and a savory odor reaching her nose.\\n\\n“Oh, I was mumbling some verses. I often do when I work, it sort of\\nhelps me along; but it must sound dreadfully silly,” and Becky\\nblushed as if caught in some serious fault.\\n\\n“I do it, and it’s a great comfort when I lie awake. I should think\\nyou WOULD want something to help you along, you work so hard. Do you\\nlike it, Becky?”\\n\\nThe familiar name, the kind tone, made the plain face brighten with\\npleasure as its owner said, while she carefully filled a pretty bowl\\nwith a golden mixture rich with fresh eggs and country milk--\\n\\n“No, I don’t, but I ought to. Mother isn’t as strong as she used to\\nbe, and there’s a sight to do, and the children to be brought up,\\nand the mortgage to be paid off; so if _I_ don’t fly round, who\\nwill? We are doing real well now, for Mr. Walker manages the farm\\nand gives us our share, so our living is all right; then boarders in\\nsummer and my school in winter helps a deal, and every year the boys\\ncan do more, so I’d be a real sinner to complain if I do have to\\nstep lively all day.”\\n\\nBecky smiled as she spoke, and straightened her bent shoulders as if\\nsettling her burden for another trudge along the path of duty.\\n\\n“Do you keep school? Why, how old are you, Becky?” asked Emily, much\\nimpressed by this new discovery.\\n\\n“I’m eighteen. I took the place of a teacher who got sick last fall,\\nand I kept school all winter. Folks seemed to like me, and I’m going\\nto have the same place this year. I’m so glad, for I needn’t go away\\nand the pay is pretty good, as the school is large and the children\\ndo well. You can see the school-house down the valley, that red\\nbrick one where the roads meet;” and Becky pointed a floury finger,\\nwith an air of pride that was pleasant to see.\\n\\nEmily glanced at the little red house where the sun shone hotly in\\nsummer, and all the winds of heaven must rage wildly in winter time,\\nfor it stood, as country schools usually do, in the barest, most\\nuninviting spot for miles around.\\n\\n“Isn’t it awful down there in winter?” she asked, with a shiver at\\nthe idea of spending days shut up in that forlorn place, with a\\ncrowd of rough country children.\\n\\n“Pretty cold, but we have plenty of wood, and we are used to snow\\nand gales up here. We often coast down, the whole lot of us, and\\nthat is great fun. We take our dinners and have games noon-spells,\\nand so we get on first rate; some of my boys are big fellows, older\\nthan I am; they clear the roads and make the fire and look after us,\\nand we are real happy together.”\\n\\nEmily found it so impossible to imagine happiness under such\\ncircumstances that she changed the subject by asking in a tone which\\nhad unconsciously grown more respectful since this last revelation\\nof Becky’s abilities,--\\n\\n“If you do so well here, why don’t you try for a larger school in a\\nbetter place?”\\n\\n“Oh, I couldn’t leave mother yet; I hope to some day, when the girls\\nare older, and the boys able to get on alone. But I can’t go now,\\nfor there’s a sight of things to do, and mother is always laid up\\nwith rheumatism in cold weather. So much butter-making down cellar\\nis bad for her; but she won’t let me do that in summer, so I take\\ncare of her in winter. I can see to things night and morning, and\\nthrough the day she’s quiet, and sits piecing carpet-rags and\\nresting up for next spring. We made and wove all the carpets in the\\nhouse, except the parlor one. Mrs. Taylor gave us that, and the\\ncurtains, and the easy-chair. Mother takes a sight of comfort in\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor is the lady who first came to board here, and told us\\nand others about it,” said Emily.\\n\\n“Yes, and she’s the kindest lady in the world! I’ll tell you all\\nabout her some day, it’s real interesting; now I must see to my\\npies, and get the vegetables on,” answered Becky, glancing at the\\ngay clock in the kitchen with an anxious look.\\n\\n“Then I won’t waste any more of your precious time. May I sit in\\nthat pretty place; or is it your private bower?” asked Emily, as she\\ndismounted from the wash-bench.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed you may. That’s mother’s resting-place when work is\\ndone. Father made the spring long ago, and I put the ferns there.\\nShe can’t go rambling round, and she likes pretty things, so we\\nfixed it up for her, and she takes comfort there nights.”\\n\\nBecky bustled off to the oven with her pies, and Emily roamed away\\nto the big barn to lie on the hay, enjoying the view down the\\nvalley, as she thought over what she had seen and heard, and very\\nnaturally contrasted her own luxurious and tenderly guarded life\\nwith this other girl’s, so hard and dull and narrow. Working all\\nsummer and teaching all winter in that dismal little school-house,\\nwith no change but home cares and carpet-weaving! It looked horrible\\nto pleasure-loving Emily, who led the happy, care-free life of\\ngirls of her class, with pleasures of all sorts, and a future of\\nstill greater luxury, variety, and happiness, opening brightly\\nbefore her.\\n\\nIt worried her to think of any one being contented with such a\\nmeagre share of the good things of life, when she was unsatisfied in\\nspite of the rich store showered upon her. She could not understand\\nit, and fell asleep wishing every one could be comfortable,--it was\\nso annoying to see them grubbing in kitchens, teaching in bleak\\nschool-houses among snow-drifts, and wearing ugly calico gowns.\\n\\nA week or two of quiet, country fare and the bracing mountain air\\nworked wonders for the invalid, and every one rejoiced to see the\\npale cheeks begin to grow round and rosy, the languid eyes to\\nbrighten, and the feeble girl who used to lie on her sofa half the\\nday now go walking about with her alpenstock, eager to explore all\\nthe pretty nooks among the hills. Her mother blessed Mrs. Taylor for\\nsuggesting this wholesome place. The tired “school marms,” as Emily\\ncalled the three young women who were their fellow-boarders,\\ncongratulated her as well as themselves on the daily improvement in\\nstrength and spirits all felt; and Becky exulted in the marvellous\\neffects of her native air, aided by mother’s good cookery and the\\ncheerful society of the children, whom the good girl considered the\\nmost remarkable and lovable youngsters in the world.\\n\\nEmily felt like the queen of this little kingdom, and was regarded\\nas such by every one, for with returning health she lost her fretful\\nways, and living with simple people, soon forgot her girlish airs\\nand vanities, becoming very sweet and friendly with all about her.\\nThe children considered her a sort of good fairy who could grant\\nwishes with magical skill, as various gifts plainly proved. The boys\\nwere her devoted servants, ready to run errands, “hitch up” and take\\nher to drive at any hour, or listen in mute delight when she sang to\\nher guitar in the summer twilight.\\n\\nBut to Becky she was a special godsend and comfort, for before the\\nfirst month had gone they were good friends, and Emily had made a\\ndiscovery which filled her head with brilliant plans for Becky’s\\nfuture, in spite of her mother’s warnings, and the sensible\\ngirl’s own reluctance to be dazzled by enthusiastic prophecies and\\ndreams.\\n\\nIt came about in this way. Some three weeks after the two girls met,\\nEmily went one evening to their favorite trysting-place,--Becky’s\\nbower among the laurels. It was a pretty nook in the shadow of a\\ngreat gray bowlder near the head of the green valley which ran down\\nto spread into the wide intervale below. A brook went babbling among\\nthe stones and grass and sweet-ferns, while all the slope was rosy\\nwith laurel-flowers in their times, as the sturdy bushes grew\\nthickly on the hill-side, down the valley, and among the woods that\\nmade a rich background for these pink and white bouquets arranged\\nwith Nature’s own careless grace.\\n\\nEmily liked this spot, and ever since she had been strong enough to\\nreach it, loved to climb up and sit there with book and work,\\nenjoying the lovely panorama before her. Floating mists often gave\\nher a constant succession of pretty pictures; now a sunny glimpse of\\nthe distant lake, then the church spire peeping above the hill, or a\\nflock of sheep feeding in the meadow, a gay procession of young\\npilgrims winding up the mountain, or a black cloud heavy with a\\ncoming storm, welcome because of the glorious rainbow and its shadow\\nwhich would close the pageant.\\n\\nUnconsciously the girl grew to feel not only the beauty but the\\nvalue of these quiet hours, to find a new peace, refreshment, and\\nhappiness, bubbling up in her heart as naturally as the brook gushed\\nout among the mossy rocks, and went singing away through hayfields\\nand gardens, and by dusty roads, till it met the river and rolled on\\nto the sea. Something dimly stirred in her, and the healing spirit\\nthat haunts such spots did its sweet ministering till the innocent\\nsoul began to see that life was not perfect without labor as well as\\nlove, duty as well as happiness, and that true contentment came from\\nwithin, not from without.\\n\\nOn the evening we speak of, she went to wait for Becky, who would\\njoin her as soon as the after-supper chores were done. In the little\\ncave which held a few books, a dipper, and a birch-bark basket for\\nberries, Emily kept a sketching block and a box of pencils, and\\noften amused herself by trying to catch some of the lovely scenes\\nbefore her. These efforts usually ended in a humbler attempt, and a\\ngood study of an oak-tree, a bit of rock, or a clump of ferns was\\nthe result. This evening the sunset was so beautiful she could not\\ndraw, and remembering that somewhere in Becky’s scrap-book there was\\na fine description of such an hour by some poet, she pulled out the\\nshabby old volume, and began to turn over the leaves.\\n\\nShe had never cared to look at it but once, having read all the best\\nof its contents in more attractive volumes, so Becky kept it tucked\\naway in the farther corner of her rustic closet, and evidently\\nthought it a safe place to conceal a certain little secret which\\nEmily now discovered. As she turned the stiff pages filled with all\\nsorts of verses, good, bad, and indifferent, a sheet of paper\\nappeared on which was scribbled these lines in school-girl\\nhandwriting:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN--LAUREL\\n\\n\\n  My bonnie flower, with truest joy\\n    Thy welcome face I see,\\n  The world grows brighter to my eyes,\\n    And summer comes with thee.\\n  My solitude now finds a friend,\\n    And after each hard day,\\n  I in my mountain garden walk,\\n    To rest, or sing, or pray.\\n\\n  All down the rocky slope is spread\\n    Thy veil of rosy snow,\\n  And in the valley by the brook,\\n    Thy deeper blossoms grow.\\n  The barren wilderness grows fair,\\n    Such beauty dost thou give;\\n  And human eyes and Nature’s heart\\n    Rejoice that thou dost live.\\n\\n  Each year I wait thy coming, dear,\\n    Each year I love thee more,\\n  For life grows hard, and much I need\\n    Thy honey for my store.\\n  So, like a hungry bee, I sip\\n    Sweet lessons from thy cup,\\n  And sitting at a flower’s feet,\\n    My soul learns to look up.\\n\\n  No laurels shall I ever win,\\n     No splendid blossoms bear,\\n  But gratefully receive and use\\n   God’s blessed sun and air;\\n  And, blooming where my lot is cast,\\n   Grow happy and content,\\n  Making some barren spot more fair,\\n   For a humble life well spent.\\n\\n“She wrote it herself! I can’t believe it!” said Emily, as she put\\ndown the paper, looking rather startled, for she DID believe it, and\\nfelt as if she had suddenly looked into a fellow-creature’s heart.\\n“I thought her just an ordinary girl, and here she is a poet,\\nwriting verses that make me want to cry! I don’t suppose they ARE\\nvery good, but they seem to come right out of her heart, and touch\\nme with the longing and the patience or the piety in them. Well, I\\nAM surprised!” and Emily read the lines again, seeing the faults\\nmore plainly than before, but still feeling that the girl put\\nherself into them, vainly trying to express what the wild flower was\\nto her in the loneliness which comes to those who have a little\\nspark of the divine fire burning in their souls.\\n\\n“Shall I tell her I’ve found it out? I must! and see if I can’t get\\nher verses printed. Of course she has more tucked away somewhere.\\nThat is what she hums to herself when she’s at work, and won’t tell\\nme about when I ask. Sly thing! to be so bashful and hide her gift.\\nI’ll tease her a bit and see what she says. Oh dear, I wish _I_\\ncould do it! Perhaps she’ll be famous some day, and then I’ll have\\nthe glory of discovering her.”\\n\\nWith that consolation Emily turned over the pages of the ledger and\\nfound several more bits of verse, some very good for an untaught\\ngirl, others very faulty, but all having a certain strength of\\nfeeling and simplicity of language unusual in the effusions of young\\nmaidens at the sentimental age.\\n\\nEmily had a girlish admiration for talent of any kind, and being\\nfond of poetry, was especially pleased to find that her humble\\nfriend possessed the power of writing it. Of course she exaggerated\\nBecky’s talent, and as she waited for her, felt sure that she had\\ndiscovered a feminine Burns among the New Hampshire hills, for all\\nthe verses were about natural and homely objects, touched into\\nbeauty by sweet words or tender sentiment. She had time to build a\\nsplendid castle in the air and settle Becky in it with a crown of\\nglory on her head, before the quiet figure in a faded sunbonnet came\\nslowly up the slope with the glow of sunset on a tired but tranquil\\nface.\\n\\n“Sit here and have a good rest, while I talk to you,” said Emily,\\neager to act the somewhat dramatic scene she had planned. Becky sunk\\nupon the red cushion prepared for her, and sat looking down at the\\nanimated speaker, as Emily, perched on a mossy stone before her,\\nbegan the performance.\\n\\n“Becky, did you ever hear of the Goodale children? They lived in the\\ncountry and wrote poetry and grew to be famous.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve read their poems and like ‘em very much. Do you know\\n‘em?” and Becky looked interested at once.\\n\\n“No, but I once met a girl who was something like them, only she\\ndidn’t have such an easy time as they did, with a father to help,\\nand a nice Sky-farm, and good luck generally. I’ve tried to write\\nverses myself, but I always get into a muddle, and give it up. This\\nmakes me interested in other girls who CAN do it, and I want to help\\nmy friend. I’m SURE she has talent, and I’d so like to give her a\\nlift in some way. Let me read you a piece of hers and see what you\\nthink of it.”\\n\\n“Do!” and Beck threw off the sunbonnet, folded her hands round her\\nknees, and composed herself to listen with such perfect\\nunconsciousness of what was coming that Emily both laughed at the\\njoke and blushed at the liberty she felt she was taking with the\\npoor girl’s carefully hidden secret.\\n\\nBecky was sure now that Emily was going to read something of her own\\nafter this artful introduction, and began to smile as the paper was\\nproduced and the first four lines read in a tone that was half\\ntimid, half triumphant. Then with a cry she seized and crumpled up\\nthe paper, exclaiming almost fiercely,--\\n\\n“It’s mine! Where did you get it? How dar’st you touch it?”\\n\\nEmily fell upon her knees with a face and voice so full of\\npenitence, pleasure, sympathy, and satisfaction, that Becky’s wrath\\nwas appeased before her friend’s explanation ended with these\\nsoothing and delightful words,--\\n\\n“That’s all, dear, and I beg your pardon. But I’m sure you will be\\nfamous if you keep on, and I shall yet see a volume of poems by\\nRebecca Moore of Rocky Nook, New Hampshire.”\\n\\nBecky hid her face as if shame, surprise, wonder, and joy filled her\\nheart too full and made a few happy tears drop on the hands so worn\\nwith hard work, when they ached to be holding a pen and trying to\\nrecord the fancies that sung in her brain as ceaselessly as the soft\\nsough of the pines or the ripple of the brook murmured in her ear\\nwhen she sat here alone. She could not express the vague longings\\nthat stirred in her soul; she could only feel and dimly strive to\\nunderstand and utter them, with no thought of fame or fortune,--for\\nshe was a humble creature, and never knew that the hardships of her\\nlife were pressing out the virtues of her nature as the tread of\\ncareless feet crush the sweet perfume from wild herbs.\\n\\nPresently she looked up, deeply touched by Emily’s words and\\ncaresses, and her blue eyes shone like stars as her face beamed with\\nsomething finer than mere beauty, for the secrets of her innocent\\nheart were known to this friend now, and it was very sweet to accept\\nthe first draught of confidence and praise.\\n\\n“I don’t mind much, but I was scared for a minute. No one knows but\\nMother, and she laughs at me, though she don’t care if it makes me\\nhappy. I’m glad you like my scribbling, but really I never think or\\nhope of being anybody. I couldn’t, you know! but it’s real nice to\\nhave you say I MIGHT and to make believe for a while.”\\n\\n“But why not, Becky? The Goodale girls did, and half the poets in\\nthe world were poor, ignorant people at first, you know. It only\\nneeds time and help, and the gift will grow, and people see it; and\\nthen the glory and the money will come,” cried Emily, quite carried\\naway by her own enthusiasm and good-will.\\n\\n“Could I get any money by these things?” asked Becky, looking at the\\ncrumpled paper lying under a laurel-bush.\\n\\n“Of course you could, dear! Let me have some of them, and I’ll show\\nyou that I know good poetry when I see it. You will believe if some\\nbank-bills come with the paper the verses appear in, I hope?”\\n\\nBlind to any harm she might do by exciting vain hopes in her\\neagerness to cheer and help, Emily made this rash proposal in all\\ngood faith, meaning to pay for the verses herself if no editor was\\nfound to accept them.\\n\\nBecky looked half bewildered by this brilliant prospect, and took a\\nlong breath, as if some hand had lifted a heavy burden a little way\\nfrom her weary back, for stronger than ambition for herself was love\\nfor her family, and the thought of help for them was sweeter than\\nany dream of fame.\\n\\n“Yes, I would! oh, if I only COULD, I’d be the happiest girl in the\\nworld! But I can’t believe it, Emily. I heard Mrs. Taylor say that\\nonly the VERY BEST poetry paid, and mine is poor stuff, I know well\\nenough.”\\n\\n“Of course it needs polishing and practice and all that; but I’m\\nsure it is oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle we see in\\nthe papers, and I KNOW that some of those pieces ARE paid for,\\nbecause I have a friend who is in a newspaper office, and he told me\\nso. Yours are quaint and simple and some very original. I’m sure\\nthat ballad of the old house is lovely, and I want to send it to\\nWhittier. Mamma knows him; it’s the sort he likes, and he is so kind\\nto every one, he will criticise it, and be interested when she tells\\nhim about you. Do let me!”\\n\\n“I never could in the world! It would be so bold, Mother would think\\nI was crazy. I love Mr. Whittier, but I wouldn’t dar’st to show him\\nmy nonsense, though reading his beautiful poetry helps me ever so\\nmuch.”\\n\\nBecky looked and spoke as if her breath had been taken away by this\\naudacious proposal; and yet a sudden delicious hope sprung up in her\\nheart that there might, perhaps, be a spark of real virtue in the\\nlittle fire which burned within her, warming and brightening her\\ndull life.\\n\\n“Let us ask Mamma; she will tell us what is best to do first, for\\nshe knows all sorts of literary people, and won’t say any more than\\nyou want her to. I’m bent on having my way, Becky, and the more\\nmodest you are, the surer I am that you are a genius. Real geniuses\\nalways ARE shy; so you just make up your mind to give me the best of\\nyour pieces, and let me prove that I’m right.”\\n\\nIt was impossible to resist such persuasive words, and Becky soon\\nyielded to the little siren who was luring her out of her safe,\\nsmall pool into the deeper water that looks so blue and smooth till\\nthe venturesome paper boats get into the swift eddies, or run\\naground upon the rocks and sandbars.\\n\\nThe greatest secrecy was to be preserved, and no one but Mrs.\\nSpenser was to know what a momentous enterprise was afoot. The girls\\nsat absorbed in their brilliant plans till it was nearly dark, then\\ngroped their way home hand in hand, leaving another secret for the\\nlaurels to keep and dream over through their long sleep, for blossom\\ntime was past, and the rosy faces turning pale in the July sun.\\n\\nNeither of the girls forgot the talk they had that night in Emily’s\\nroom, for she led her captive straight to her mother, and told her\\nall their plans and aspirations without a moment’s delay.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser much regretted her daughter’s well-meant enthusiasm,\\nbut fearing harm might be done, very wisely tried to calm the\\ninnocent excitement of both by the quiet matter-of-fact way in which\\nshe listened to the explanation Emily gave her, read the verses\\ntimidly offered by Becky, and then said, kindly but firmly:--\\n\\n“This is not poetry, my dear girls, though the lines run smoothly\\nenough, and the sentiment is sweet. It would bring neither fame nor\\nmoney, and Rebecca puts more real truth, beauty, and poetry into her\\ndutiful daily life than in any lines she has written.”\\n\\n“We had such a lovely plan for Becky to come to town with me, and\\nsee the world, and write, and be famous. How can you spoil it all?”\\n\\n“My foolish little daughter, I must prevent you from spoiling this\\ngood girl’s life by your rash projects. Becky will see that I am\\nwise, though you do not, and SHE will understand this verse from my\\nfavorite poet, and lay it to heart:--\\n\\n  “So near is grandeur to our Dust,\\n   So nigh is God to man,\\n   When Duty whispers low, ‘Thou must!’\\n    The youth replies, ‘I can!’”\\n\\n“I do! I will! please go on,” and Becky’s troubled eyes grew clear\\nand steadfast as she took the words home to herself, resolving to\\nlive up to them.\\n\\n“Oh, mother!” cried Emily, thinking her very cruel to nip their\\nbudding hopes in this way.\\n\\n“I know you won’t believe it now, nor be able to see all that I mean\\nperhaps, but time will teach you both to own that I am right, and to\\nvalue the substance more than the shadow,” continued Mrs. Spenser.\\n“Many girls write verses and think they are poets; but it is only a\\npassing mood, and fortunately for the world, and for them also, it\\nsoon dies out in some more genuine work or passion. Very few have\\nthe real gift, and those to whom it IS given wait and work and\\nslowly reach the height of their powers. Many delude themselves, and\\ntry to persuade the world that they can sing; but it is waste of\\ntime, and ends in disappointment, as the mass of sentimental rubbish\\nwe all see plainly proves. Write your little verses, my dear, when\\nthe spirit moves,--it is a harmless pleasure, a real comfort, and a\\ngood lesson for you; but do not neglect higher duties or deceive\\nyourself with false hopes and vain dreams. ‘First live, then write,’\\nis a good motto for ambitious young people. A still better for us\\nall is, ‘Do the duty that lies nearest;’ and the faithful\\nperformance of that, no matter how humble it is, will be the best\\nhelp for whatever talent may lie hidden in us, ready to bloom when\\nthe time comes. Remember this, and do not let my enthusiastic girl’s\\nwell-meant but unwise prophecies and plans unsettle you, and unfit\\nyou for the noble work you are doing.”\\n\\n“Thank you, ma’am! I WILL remember; I know you are right, and I\\nwon’t be upset by foolish notions. I never imagined before that I\\nCOULD be a poet; but it sounded so sort of splendid, I thought maybe\\nit MIGHT happen to me, by-and-by, as it does to other folks. I\\nwon’t lot on it, but settle right down and do my work cheerful.”\\n\\nAs she listened, Becky’s face had grown pale and serious, even a\\nlittle sad; but as she answered, her eyes shone, her lips were firm,\\nand her plain face almost beautiful with the courage and confidence\\nthat sprung up within her. She saw the wisdom of her friend’s\\nadvice, felt the kindness of showing her the mistake frankly, and\\nwas grateful for it,--conscious in her own strong, loving heart that\\nit was better to live and work for others than to dream and strive\\nfor herself alone.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser was both surprised and touched by the girl’s look,\\nwords, and manner, and her respect much increased by the courage and\\ngood temper with which she saw her lovely castle in the air vanish\\nlike smoke, leaving the hard reality looking harder than ever, after\\nthis little flight into the fairy regions of romance.\\n\\nShe talked long with the girls, and gave them the counsel all eager\\nyoung people need, yet are very slow to accept till experience\\nteaches them its worth. As the friend of many successful literary\\npeople, Mrs. Spenser was constantly receiving the confidences of\\nunfledged scribblers, each of whom was sure that he or she had\\nsomething valuable to add to the world’s literature. Her advice was\\nalways the same, “Work and wait;” and only now and then was a young\\npoet or author found enough in earnest to do both, and thereby prove\\nto themselves and others that either they DID possess power, or did\\nnot, and so settle the question forever. “First live, then write,”\\n proved a quietus for many, and “Do the duty that lies nearest”\\n satisfied the more sincere that they could be happy without fame.\\nSo, thanks to this wise and kindly woman, a large number of worthy\\nyouths and maidens ceased dreaming and fell to work, and the world\\nwas spared reams of feeble verse and third-rate romances.\\n\\nAfter that night Becky spent fewer spare hours in her nest, and more\\nin reading with Emily, who lent her books and helped her to\\nunderstand them,--both much assisted by Mrs. Spenser, who marked\\npassages, suggested authors, and explained whatever puzzled them.\\nVery happy bits of time were these, and very precious to both, as\\nEmily learned to see and appreciate the humbler, harder side of\\nlife, and Becky got delightful glimpses into the beautiful world of\\nart, poetry, and truth, which gave her better food for heart and\\nbrain than sentimental musings or blind efforts to satisfy the\\nhunger of her nature with verse-writing.\\n\\nTheir favorite places were in the big barn, on the front porch, or\\nby the spring. This last was Emily’s schoolroom, and she both taught\\nand learned many useful lessons there.\\n\\nOne day as Becky came to rest a few minutes and shell peas, Emily\\nput down her book to help; and as the pods flew, she said, nodding\\ntoward the delicate ferns that grew thickly all about the trough,\\nthe rock, and the grassy bank,--\\n\\n“We have these in our greenhouse, but I never saw them growing wild\\nbefore, and I don’t find them anywhere up here. How did you get such\\nbeauties, and make them do so well?”\\n\\n“Oh, they grow in nooks on the mountain hidden under the taller\\nferns, and in sly corners. But they don’t grow like these, and die\\nsoon unless transplanted and taken good care of. They always make me\\nthink of you,--so graceful and delicate, and just fit to live with\\ntea-roses in a hot-house, and go to balls in beautiful ladies’\\nbokays,” answered Becky, smiling at her new friend, always so\\ndainty, and still so delicate in spite of the summer’s rustication.\\n\\n“Thank you! I suppose I shall never be very strong or able to do\\nmuch; so I AM rather like a fern, and do live in a conservatory all\\nwinter, as I can’t go out a great deal. An idle thing, Becky!” and\\nEmily sighed, for she was born frail, and even her tenderly guarded\\nlife could not give her the vigor of other girls. But the sigh\\nchanged to a smile as she added,--\\n\\n“If I am like the fern, you are like your own laurel,--strong, rosy,\\nand able to grow anywhere. I want to carry a few roots home, and see\\nif they won’t grow in my garden. Then you will have me, and I you. I\\nonly hope YOUR plant will do as well as mine does here.”\\n\\n“It won’t! ever so many folks have taken roots away, but they never\\nthrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong. So I\\ntell ‘em to leave the dear bushes alone, and come up here and enjoy\\n‘em in their own place. You might keep a plant of it in your\\nhot-house, and it would blow I dare say; but it would never be half\\nso lovely as my acres of them, and I guess it would only make you\\nsad, seeing it so far from home, and pale and pining,” answered\\nBecky, with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountain-laurel\\nbraved the wintry snow, and came out fresh and early in the spring.\\n\\n“Then I’ll let it alone till I come next summer. But don’t you take\\nany of the fern into the house in the cold weather? I should think\\nit would grow in your sunny windows,” said Emily, pleased by the\\nfancy that it resembled herself.\\n\\n“I tried it, but it needs a damp place, and our cold nights kill it.\\nNo, it won’t grow in our old house; but I cover it with leaves, and\\nthe little green sprouts come up as hearty as can be out here. The\\nshade, the spring, the shelter of the rock, keep it alive, you see,\\nso it’s no use trying to move it.”\\n\\nBoth sat silent for a few minutes, as their hands moved briskly and\\nthey thought of their different lots. An inquisitive ray of sunshine\\npeeped in at them, touching Becky’s hair till it shone like red\\ngold. The same ray dazzled Emily’s eyes; she put up her hand to pull\\nher hat-brim lower, and touched the little curls on her forehead.\\nThis recalled her pet grievance, and made her say impatiently, as\\nshe pushed the thick short locks under her net,--\\n\\n“My hair is SUCH a plague! I don’t know what I am to do when I go\\ninto society by-and-by. This crop is so unbecoming, and I can’t\\nmatch my hair anywhere, it is such a peculiar shade of golden-auburn.”\\n\\n“It’s a pretty color, and I think the curls much nicer than a\\nboughten switch,” said Becky, quite unconscious that her own\\nluxuriant locks were of the true Titian red, and would be much\\nadmired by artistic eyes.\\n\\n“I don’t! I shall send to Paris to match it, and then wear a braid\\nround my head as you do sometimes. I suppose it will cost a fortune,\\nbut I WON’T have a strong-minded crop. A friend of mine got a lovely\\ngolden switch for fifty dollars.”\\n\\n“My patience! do folks pay like that for false hair?” asked Becky,\\namazed.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed. White hair costs a hundred, I believe, if it is long.\\nWhy, you could get ever so much for yours if you ever wanted to sell\\nit. I’ll take part of it, for in a little while mine will be as\\ndark, and I’d like to wear your hair, Becky.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mother would let me. She is very proud of our red\\nheads. If I ever do cut it, you shall have some. I may be hard up\\nand glad to sell it perhaps. My sakes! I smell the cake burning!”\\n and off flew Becky to forget the chat in her work.\\n\\nEmily did not forget it, and hoped Becky would be tempted, for she\\nreally coveted one of the fine braids, but felt shy about asking the\\npoor girl for even a part of her one beauty.\\n\\nSo July and August passed pleasantly and profitably to both girls,\\nand in September they were to part. No more was said about poetry;\\nand Emily soon became so interested in the busy, practical life\\nabout her that her own high-flown dreams were quite forgotten, and\\nshe learned to enjoy the sweet prose of daily labor.\\n\\nOne breezy afternoon as she and her mother sat resting from a stroll\\non the way-side bank among the golden-rod and asters, they saw Becky\\ncoming up the long hill with a basket on her arm. She walked slowly,\\nas if lost in thought, yet never missed pushing aside with a decided\\ngesture of her foot every stone that lay in her way. There were many\\nin that rocky path, but Becky left it smoother as she climbed, and\\npaused now and then to send some especially sharp or large one\\nspinning into the grassy ditch beside the road.\\n\\n“Isn’t she a curious girl, Mamma? so tired after her long walk to\\ntown, yet so anxious not to leave a stone in the way,” said Emily,\\nas they watched her slow approach.\\n\\n“A very interesting one to me, dear, because under that humble\\nexterior lies a fine, strong character. It is like Becky to clear\\nher way, even up a dusty hill where the first rain will wash out\\nmany more stones. Let us ask her why she does it. I’ve observed the\\nhabit before, and always meant to ask,” replied Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Here we are! Come and rest a minute, Becky, and tell us if you mend\\nroads as well as ever so many other things;” called Emily, beckoning\\nwith a smile, as the girl looked up and saw them.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a trick of mine; I caught it of Father when I was a little\\nthing, and do it without knowing it half the time,” said Becky,\\nsinking down upon a mossy rock, as if rest were welcome.\\n\\n“Why did he do it?” asked Emily, who knew that her friend loved to\\ntalk of her father.\\n\\n“Well, it’s a family failing I guess, for his father did the same,\\nonly HE began with his farm and let the roads alone. The land used\\nto be pretty much all rocks up here, you know, and farmers had to\\nclear the ground if they wanted crops. It was a hard fight, and took\\na sight of time and patience to grub out roots and blast rocks and\\npick up stones that seemed to grow faster than anything else. But\\nthey kept on, and now see!”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Becky pointed proudly to the wide, smooth fields lying\\nbefore them, newly shorn of grass or grain, waving with corn, or\\nrich in garden crops ripening for winter stores. Here and there were\\nrocky strips unreclaimed, as if to show what had been done; and\\nmassive stone walls surrounded pasture, field, and garden.\\n\\n“A good lesson in patience and perseverance, my dear, and does great\\nhonor to the men who made the wilderness blossom like the rose,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Then you can’t wonder that they loved it and we want to keep it. I\\nguess it would break Mother’s heart to sell this place, and we are\\nall working as hard as ever we can to pay off the mortgage. Then\\nwe’ll be just the happiest family in New Hampshire,” said Becky,\\nfondly surveying the old farm-house, the rocky hill, and the\\nprecious fields won from the forest.\\n\\n“You never need fear to lose it; we will see to that if you will let\\nus,” began Mrs. Spenser, who was both a rich and a generous woman.\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! but we won’t need help I guess; and if we should,\\nMrs. Taylor made us promise to come to her,” cried Becky. “She found\\nus just in our hardest time, and wanted to fix things then; but we\\nare proud in our way, and Mother said she’d rather work it off if\\nshe could. Then what did that dear lady do but talk to the folks\\nround here, and show ‘em how a branch railroad down to Peeksville\\nwould increase the value of the land, and how good this valley would\\nbe for strawberries and asparagus and garden truck if we could only\\nget it to market. Some of the rich men took up the plan, and we hope\\nit will be done this fall. It will be the making of us, for our land\\nis first-rate for small crops, and the children can help at that,\\nand with a deepot close by it would be such easy work. That’s what I\\ncall helping folks to help themselves. Won’t it be grand?”\\n\\nBecky looked so enthusiastic that Emily could not remain\\nuninterested, though market-gardening did not sound very romantic.\\n\\n“I hope it will come, and next year we shall see you all hard at it.\\nWhat a good woman Mrs. Taylor is!”\\n\\n“Ain’t she? and the sad part of it is, she can’t do and enjoy all\\nshe wants to, because her health is so poor. She was a country girl,\\nyou know, and went to work in the city as waiter in a boarding-house.\\nA rich man fell in love with her and married her, and she took care\\nof him for years, and he left her all his money. She was quite broken\\ndown, but she wanted to make his name loved and honored after his\\ndeath, as he hadn’t done any good while he lived; so she gives away\\nheaps, and is never tired of helping poor folks and doing all sorts\\nof grand things to make the world better. I call that splendid!”\\n\\n“So do I, yet it is only what you are doing in a small way, Becky,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser, as the girl paused out of breath. “Mrs. Taylor\\nclears the stones out of people’s paths, making their road easier to\\nclimb than hers has been, and leaving behind her fruitful fields for\\nothers to reap. This is a better work than making verses, for it is\\nthe real poetry of life, and brings to those who give themselves to\\nit, no matter in what humble ways, something sweeter than fame and\\nmore enduring than fortune.”\\n\\n“So it does! I see that now, and know why we love Father as we do,\\nand want to keep what he worked so hard to give us. He used to say\\nevery stone cleared away was just so much help to the boys; and he\\nused to tell me his plans as I trotted after him round the farm,\\nhelping all I could, being the oldest, and like him, he said.”\\n\\nBecky paused with full eyes, for not even to these good friends\\ncould she ever tell the shifts and struggles in which she had\\nbravely borne her part during the long hard years that had wrested\\nthe little homestead from the stony-hearted hills.\\n\\nThe musical chime of a distant clock reminded her that supper time\\nwas near, and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant\\nrest by the way-side. As she pulled out her handkerchief, a little\\nroll of pale blue ribbon fell from her pocket, and Emily caught it\\nup, exclaiming mischievously, “Are you going to make yourself fine\\nnext Sunday, when Moses Pennel calls, Becky?”\\n\\nThe girl laughed and blushed as she said, carefully folding up the\\nribbon,--\\n\\n“I’m going to do something with it that I like a sight better than\\nthat. Poor Moses won’t come any more, I guess. I’m not going to\\nleave Mother till the girls can take my place, and only then to\\nteach, if I can get a good school somewhere near.”\\n\\n“We shall see!” and Emily nodded wisely.\\n\\n“We shall!” and Becky nodded decidedly, as she trudged on up the\\nsteep hill beside Mrs. Spenser, while Emily walked slowly behind,\\npoking every stone she saw into the grass, unmindful of the\\ndetriment to her delicate shoes, being absorbed in a new and\\ncharming idea of trying to follow Mrs. Taylor’s example in a small\\nway.\\n\\nA week later the last night came, and just as they were parting for\\nbed, in rushed one of the boys with the exciting news that the\\nrailroad surveyors were in town, the folks talking about the grand\\nenterprise, and the fortune of the place made forever.\\n\\nGreat was the rejoicing in the old farm-house; the boys cheered, the\\nlittle girls danced, the two mothers dropped a happy tear as they\\nshook each other’s hands, and Emily embraced Becky, tenderly\\nexclaiming,--“There, you dear thing, is a great stone shoved out of\\nYOUR way, and a clear road to fortune at last; for I shall tell all\\nmy friends to buy your butter and eggs, and fruit and pigs, and\\neverything you send to market on that blessed railroad.”\\n\\n“A keg of our best winter butter is going by stage express to-morrow\\nanyway; and when our apples come, we shan’t need a railroad to get\\n‘em to you, my darling dear,” answered Becky, holding the delicate\\ngirl in her arms with a look and gesture half sisterly, half\\nmotherly, wholly fond and grateful.\\n\\nWhen Emily got to her room, she found that butter and apples were\\nnot all the humble souvenirs offered in return for many comfortable\\ngifts to the whole family.\\n\\nOn the table, in a pretty birch-bark cover, lay several of Becky’s\\nbest poems neatly copied, as Emily had expressed a wish to keep\\nthem; and round the rustic volume, like a ring of red gold, lay a\\ngreat braid of Becky’s hair, tied with the pale blue ribbon she had\\nwalked four miles to buy, that her present might look its best.\\n\\nOf course there were more embraces and kisses, and thanks and loving\\nwords, before Emily at last lulled herself to sleep planning a\\nChristmas box, which should supply every wish and want of the entire\\nfamily if she could find them out.\\n\\nNext morning they parted; but these were not mere summer friends,\\nand they did not lose sight of one another, though their ways lay\\nfar apart. Emily had found a new luxury to bring more pleasure into\\nlife, a new medicine to strengthen soul and body; and in helping\\nothers, she helped herself wonderfully.\\n\\nBecky went steadily on her dutiful way, till the homestead was free,\\nthe lads able to work the farm alone, the girls old enough to fill\\nher place, and the good mother willing to rest at last among her\\nchildren. Then Becky gave herself to teaching,--a noble task, for\\nwhich she was well fitted, and in which she found both profit and\\npleasure, as she led her flock along the paths from which she\\nremoved the stumbling-blocks for their feet, as well as for her\\nown. She put her poetry into her life, and made of it “a grand sweet\\nsong” in which beauty and duty rhymed so well that the country girl\\nbecame a more useful, beloved, and honored woman than if she had\\ntried to sing for fame which never satisfies.\\n\\nSo each symbolical plant stood in its own place, and lived its\\nappointed life. The delicate fern grew in the conservatory among\\ntea-roses and camelias, adding grace to every bouquet of which it\\nformed a part, whether it faded in a ball-room, or was carefully\\ncherished by some poor invalid’s bed-side,--a frail thing, yet with\\ntenacious roots and strong stem, nourished by memories of the rocky\\nnook where it had learned its lesson so well. The mountain-laurel\\nclung to the bleak hillside, careless of wintry wind and snow, as\\nits sturdy branches spread year by year, with its evergreen leaves\\nfor Christmas cheer, its rosy flowers for spring-time, its fresh\\nbeauty free to all as it clothed the wild valley with a charm that\\nmade a little poem of the lovely spot where the pines whispered,\\nwoodbirds sang, and the hidden brook told the sweet message it\\nbrought from the mountain-top where it was born.\\n\\n\\nThe End.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s A Garland for Girls, by Louisa May Alcott\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A GARLAND FOR GIRLS ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 5830-0.txt or 5830-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/3/5830/\\n\\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo and the Online Distributed\\nProofreading Team\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n']]"

The flowers which were my solace and pleasure\\nsuggested titles for the tales and gave an interest to the work.\\n\\nIf my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common\\nblossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.\\n\\nL.M. ALCOTT.\\n\\nSEPTEMBER, 1887.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMAY FLOWERS\\n\\n\\nBeing Boston girls, of course they got up a club for mental\\nimprovement, and, as they were all descendants of the Pilgrim\\nFathers, they called it the Mayflower Club. A very good name, and\\nthe six young girls who were members of it made a very pretty posy\\nwhen they met together, once a week, to sew, and read well-chosen\\nbooks. At the first meeting of the season, after being separated all\\nsummer, there was a good deal of gossip to be attended to before the\\nquestion, “What shall we read?” came up for serious discussion.\\n\\nAnna Winslow, as president, began by proposing “Happy Dodd;” but a\\nchorus of “I’ve read it!” made her turn to her list for another\\ntitle.\\n\\n“‘Prisoners of Poverty’ is all about workingwomen, very true and\\nvery sad; but Mamma said it might do us good to know something of\\nthe hard times other girls have,” said Anna, soberly; for she was a\\nthoughtful creature, very anxious to do her duty in all ways.\\n\\n“I’d rather not know about sad things, since I can’t help to make\\nthem any better,” answered Ella Carver, softly patting the apple\\nblossoms she was embroidering on a bit of blue satin.\\n\\n“But we might help if we really tried, I suppose; you know how much\\nHappy Dodd did when she once began, and she was only a poor little\\ngirl without half the means of doing good which we have,” said Anna,\\nglad to discuss the matter, for she had a little plan in her head\\nand wanted to prepare a way for proposing it.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m always saying that I have more than my share of fun and\\ncomfort and pretty things, and that I ought and will share them with\\nsome one. But I don’t do it; and now and then, when I hear about\\nreal poverty, or dreadful sickness, I feel so wicked it quite upsets\\nme. If I knew HOW to begin, I really would. But dirty little\\nchildren don’t come in my way, nor tipsy women to be reformed, nor\\nnice lame girls to sing and pray with, as it all happens in books,”\\n cried Marion Warren, with such a remorseful expression on her merry\\nround face that her mates laughed with one accord.\\n\\n“I know something that I COULD do if I only had the courage to begin\\nit. But Papa would shake his head unbelievingly, and Mamma worry\\nabout its being proper, and it would interfere with my music, and\\neverything nice that I especially wanted to go to would be sure\\nto come on whatever day I set for my good work, and I should get\\ndiscouraged or ashamed, and not half do it, so I don’t begin, but I\\nknow I ought.” And Elizabeth Alden rolled her large eyes from one\\nfriend to another, as if appealing to them to goad her to this duty\\nby counsel and encouragement of some sort.\\n\\n“Well, I suppose it’s right, but I do perfectly hate to go poking\\nround among poor folks, smelling bad smells, seeing dreadful sights,\\nhearing woful tales, and running the risk of catching fever, and\\ndiphtheria, and horrid things. I don’t pretend to like charity, but\\nsay right out I’m a silly, selfish wretch, and want to enjoy every\\nminute, and not worry about other people. Isn’t it shameful?”\\n\\nMaggie Bradford looked such a sweet little sinner as she boldly made\\nthis sad confession, that no one could scold her, though Ida\\nStandish, her bosom friend, shook her head, and Anna said, with a\\nsigh: “I’m afraid we all feel very much as Maggie does, though we\\ndon’t own it so honestly. Last spring, when I was ill and thought I\\nmight die, I was so ashamed of my idle, frivolous winter, that I\\nfelt as if I’d give all I had to be able to live it over and do\\nbetter. Much is not expected of a girl of eighteen, I know; but oh!\\nthere were heaps of kind little things I MIGHT have done if I hadn’t\\nthought only of myself. I resolved if I lived I’d try at least to be\\nless selfish, and make some one happier for my being in the world. I\\ntell you, girls, it’s rather solemn when you lie expecting to die,\\nand your sins come up before you, even though they are very small\\nones. I never shall forget it, and after my lovely summer I mean to\\nbe a better girl, and lead a better life if I can.”\\n\\nAnna was so much in earnest that her words, straight out of a very\\ninnocent and contrite heart, touched her hearers deeply, and put\\nthem into the right mood to embrace her proposition. No one spoke\\nfor a moment, then Maggie said quietly,--\\n\\n“I know what it is. I felt very much so when the horses ran away,\\nand for fifteen minutes I sat clinging to Mamma, expecting to be\\nkilled. Every unkind, undutiful word I’d ever said to her came back\\nto me, and was worse to bear than the fear of sudden death. It\\nscared a great deal of naughtiness out of me, and dear Mamma and I\\nhave been more to each other ever since.”\\n\\n“Let us begin with ‘The Prisoners of Poverty,’ and perhaps it will\\nshow us something to do,” said Lizzie. “But I must say I never felt\\nas if shop-girls needed much help; they generally seem so contented\\nwith themselves, and so pert or patronizing to us, that I don’t pity\\nthem a bit, though it must be a hard life.”\\n\\n“I think we can’t do MUCH in that direction, except set an example\\nof good manners when we go shopping. I wanted to propose that we\\neach choose some small charity for this winter, and do it\\nfaithfully. That will teach us how to do more by and by, and we can\\nhelp one another with our experiences, perhaps, or amuse with our\\nfailures. What do you say?” asked Anna, surveying her five friends\\nwith a persuasive smile.\\n\\n“What COULD we do?”\\n\\n“People will call us goody-goody.”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea how to go to work.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mamma will let me.”\\n\\n“We’d better change our names from May Flowers to sisters of\\ncharity, and wear meek black bonnets and flapping cloaks.”\\n\\nAnna received these replies with great composure, and waited for the\\nmeeting to come to order, well knowing that the girls would have\\ntheir fun and outcry first, and then set to work in good earnest.\\n\\n“I think it’s a lovely idea, and I’ll carry out my plan. But I won’t\\ntell what it is yet; you’d all shout, and say I couldn’t do it, but\\nif you were trying also, that would keep me up to the mark,” said\\nLizzie, with a decided snap of her scissors, as she trimmed the\\nedges of a plush case for her beloved music.\\n\\n“Suppose we all keep our attempts secret, and not let our right hand\\nknow what the left hand does? It’s such fun to mystify people, and\\nthen no one can laugh at us. If we fail, we can say nothing; if we\\nsucceed, we can tell of it and get our reward. I’d like that way,\\nand will look round at once for some especially horrid boot-black,\\nungrateful old woman, or ugly child, and devote myself to him, her,\\nor it with the patience of a saint,” cried Maggie, caught by the\\nidea of doing good in secret and being found out by accident.\\n\\nThe other girls agreed, after some discussion, and then Anna took\\nthe floor again.\\n\\n“I propose that we each work in our own way till next May, then, at\\nour last meeting, report what we have done, truly and honestly, and\\nplan something better for next year. Is it a vote?”\\n\\nIt evidently was a unanimous vote, for five gold thimbles went up,\\nand five blooming faces smiled as the five girlish voices cried,\\n“Aye!”\\n\\n“Very well, now let us decide what to read, and begin at once. I\\nthink the ‘Prisoners’ a good book, and we shall doubtless get some\\nhints from it.”\\n\\nSo they began, and for an hour one pleasant voice after the other\\nread aloud those sad, true stories of workingwomen and their hard\\nlives, showing these gay young creatures what their pretty clothes\\ncost the real makers of them, and how much injustice, suffering, and\\nwasted strength went into them. It was very sober reading, but most\\nabsorbing; for the crochet needles went slower and slower, the\\nlace-work lay idle, and a great tear shone like a drop of dew on the\\napple blossoms as Ella listened to “Rose’s Story.” They skipped the\\nstatistics, and dipped here and there as each took her turn; but\\nwhen the two hours were over, and it was time for the club to\\nadjourn, all the members were deeply interested in that pathetic\\nbook, and more in earnest than before; for this glimpse into other\\nlives showed them how much help was needed, and made them anxious to\\nlend a hand.\\n\\n“We can’t do much, being ‘only girls,’” said Anna; “but if each does\\none small chore somewhere it will pave the way for better work; so\\nwe will all try, at least, though it seems like so many ants trying\\nto move a mountain.”\\n\\n“Well, ants build nests higher than a man’s head in Africa; you\\nremember the picture of them in our old geographies? And we can do\\nas much, I’m sure, if each tugs her pebble or straw faithfully. I\\nshall shoulder mine to-morrow if Mamma is willing,” answered Lizzie,\\nshutting up her work-bag as if she had her resolution inside and was\\nafraid it might evaporate before she got home.\\n\\n“I shall stand on the Common, and proclaim aloud, ‘Here’s a nice\\nyoung missionary, in want of a job! Charity for sale cheap! Who’ll\\nbuy? who’ll buy?’” said Maggie, with a resigned expression, and a\\nsanctimonious twang to her voice.\\n\\n“I shall wait and see what comes to me, since I don’t know what I’m\\nfit for;” and Marion gazed out of the window as if expecting to see\\nsome interesting pauper waiting for her to appear.\\n\\n“I shall ask Miss Bliss for advice; she knows all about the poor,\\nand will give me a good start,” added prudent Ida, who resolved to\\ndo nothing rashly lest she should fail.\\n\\n“I shall probably have a class of dirty little girls, and teach them\\nhow to sew, as I can’t do anything else. They won’t learn much, but\\nsteal, and break, and mess, and be a dreadful trial, and I shall get\\nlaughed at and wish I hadn’t done it. Still I shall try it, and\\nsacrifice my fancy-work to the cause of virtue,” said Ella,\\ncarefully putting away her satin glove-case with a fond glance at\\nthe delicate flowers she so loved to embroider.\\n\\n“I have no plans, but want to do so much! I shall have to wait till\\nI discover what is best. After to-day we won’t speak of our work, or\\nit won’t be a secret any longer. In May we will report. Good luck to\\nall, and good-by till next Saturday.”\\n\\nWith these farewell words from their president the girls departed,\\nwith great plans and new ideas simmering in their young heads and\\nhearts.\\n\\nIt seemed a vast undertaking; but where there is a will there is\\nalways a way, and soon it was evident that each had found “a little\\nchore” to do for sweet charity’s sake. Not a word was said at the\\nweekly meetings, but the artless faces betrayed all shades of hope,\\ndiscouragement, pride, and doubt, as their various attempts seemed\\nlikely to succeed or fail. Much curiosity was felt, and a few\\naccidental words, hints, or meetings in queer places, were very\\nexciting, though nothing was discovered.\\n\\nMarion was often seen in a North End car, and Lizzie in a South End\\ncar, with a bag of books and papers. Ella haunted a certain shop\\nwhere fancy articles were sold, and Ida always brought plain sewing\\nto the club. Maggie seemed very busy at home, and Anna was found\\nwriting industriously several times when one of her friends called.\\nAll seemed very happy, and rather important when outsiders\\nquestioned them about their affairs. But they had their pleasures as\\nusual, and seemed to enjoy them with an added relish, as if they\\nrealized as never before how many blessings they possessed, and were\\ngrateful for them.\\n\\nSo the winter passed, and slowly something new and pleasant seemed\\nto come into the lives of these young girls. The listless,\\ndiscontented look some of them used to wear passed away; a sweet\\nearnestness and a cheerful activity made them charming, though they\\ndid not know it, and wondered when people said, “That set of girls\\nare growing up beautifully; they will make fine women by and by.”\\n The mayflowers were budding under the snow, and as spring came on\\nthe fresh perfume began to steal out, the rosy faces to brighten,\\nand the last year’s dead leaves to fall away, leaving the young\\nplants green and strong.\\n\\nOn the 15th of May the club met for the last time that season, as\\nsome left town early, and all were full of spring work and summer\\nplans. Every member was in her place at an unusually early hour that\\nday, and each wore an air of mingled anxiety, expectation, and\\nsatisfaction, pleasant to behold. Anna called them to order with\\nthree raps of her thimble and a beaming smile.\\n\\n“We need not choose a book for our reading to-day, as each of us is\\nto contribute an original history of her winter’s work. I know it\\nwill be very interesting, and I hope more instructive, than some of\\nthe novels we have read. Who shall begin?”\\n\\n“You! you!” was the unanimous answer; for all loved and respected\\nher very much, and felt that their presiding officer should open the\\nball.\\n\\nAnna colored modestly, but surprised her friends by the composure\\nwith which she related her little story, quite as if used to public\\nspeaking.\\n\\n“You know I told you last November that I should have to look about\\nfor something that I COULD do. I did look a long time, and was\\nrather in despair, when my task came to me in the most unexpected\\nway. Our winter work was being done, so I had a good deal of\\nshopping on my hands, and found it less a bore than usual, because I\\nliked to watch the shop-girls, and wish I dared ask some of them if\\nI could help them. I went often to get trimmings and buttons at\\nCotton’s, and had a good deal to do with the two girls at that\\ncounter. They were very obliging and patient about matching some jet\\nornaments for Mamma, and I found out that their names were Mary and\\nMaria Porter. I liked them, for they were very neat and plain in\\ntheir dress,--not like some, who seem to think that if their waists\\nare small, and their hair dressed in the fashion, it is no matter\\nhow soiled their collars are, nor how untidy their nails. Well, one\\nday when I went for certain kinds of buttons which were to be made\\nfor us, Maria, the younger one, who took the order, was not there. I\\nasked for her, and Mary said she was at home with a lame knee. I was\\nso sorry, and ventured to put a few questions in a friendly way.\\nMary seemed glad to tell her troubles, and I found that ‘Ria,’ as\\nshe called her sister, had been suffering for a long time, but did\\nnot complain for fear of losing her place. No stools are allowed at\\nCotton’s, so the poor girls stand nearly all day, or rest a minute\\nnow and then on a half-opened drawer. I’d seen Maria doing it, and\\nwondered why some one did not make a stir about seats in this place,\\nas they have in other stores and got stools for the shop women. I\\ndidn’t dare to speak to the gentlemen, but I gave Mary the Jack\\nroses I wore in my breast, and asked if I might take some books or\\nflowers to poor Maria. It was lovely to see her sad face light up\\nand hear her thank me when I went to see her, for she was very\\nlonely without her sister, and discouraged about her place. She did\\nnot lose it entirely, but had to work at home, for her lame knee\\nwill be a long time in getting well. I begged Mamma and Mrs.\\nAilingham to speak to Mr. Cotton for her; so she got the mending of\\nthe jet and bead work to do, and buttons to cover, and things of\\nthat sort. Mary takes them to and fro, and Maria feels so happy not\\nto be idle. We also got stools, for all the other girls in that\\nshop. Mrs. Allingham is so rich and kind she can do anything, and\\nnow it’s such a comfort to see those tired things resting when off\\nduty that I often go in and enjoy the sight.”\\n\\nAnna paused as cries of “Good! good!” interrupted her tale; but she\\ndid not add the prettiest part of it, and tell how the faces of the\\nyoung women behind the counters brightened when she came in, nor how\\ngladly all served the young lady who showed them what a true\\ngentlewoman was.\\n\\n“I hope that isn’t all?” said Maggie, eagerly.\\n\\n“Only a little more. I know you will laugh when I tell you that I’ve\\nbeen reading papers to a class of shop-girls at the Union once a\\nweek all winter.”\\n\\nA murmur of awe and admiration greeted this deeply interesting\\nstatement; for, true to the traditions of the modern Athens in which\\nthey lived, the girls all felt the highest respect for “papers” on\\nany subject, it being the fashion for ladies, old and young, to read\\nand discuss every subject, from pottery to Pantheism, at the various\\nclubs all over the city.\\n\\n“It came about very naturally,” continued Anna, as if anxious to\\nexplain her seeming audacity. “I used to go to see Molly and Ria,\\nand heard all about their life and its few pleasures, and learned to\\nlike them more and more. They had only each other in the world,\\nlived in two rooms, worked all day, and in the way of amusement or\\ninstruction had only what they found at the Union in the evening. I\\nwent with them a few times, and saw how useful and pleasant it was,\\nand wanted to help, as other kind girls only a little older than I\\ndid. Eva Randal read a letter from a friend in Russia one time, and\\nthe girls enjoyed it very much. That reminded me of my brother\\nGeorge’s lively journals, written when he was abroad. You remember\\nhow we used to laugh over them when he sent them home? Well, when I\\nwas begged to give them an evening, I resolved to try one of those\\namusing journal-letters, and chose the best,--all about how George\\nand a friend went to the different places Dickens describes in some\\nof his funny books. I wish you could have seen how those dear girls\\nenjoyed it, and laughed till they cried over the dismay of the boys,\\nwhen they knocked at a door in Kingsgate Street, and asked if Mrs.\\nGamp lived there. It was actually a barber’s shop, and a little man,\\nvery like Poll Sweedlepipes, told them ‘Mrs. Britton was the nuss as\\nlived there now.’ It upset those rascals to come so near the truth,\\nand they ran away because they couldn’t keep sober.”\\n\\nThe members of the club indulged in a general smile as they recalled\\nthe immortal Sairey with “the bottle on the mankle-shelf,” the\\n“cowcuber,” and the wooden pippins. Then Anna continued, with an air\\nof calm satisfaction, quite sure now of her audience and herself,--\\n\\n“It was a great success. So I went on, and when the journals were\\ndone, I used to read other things, and picked up books for their\\nlibrary, and helped in any way I could, while learning to know them\\nbetter and give them confidence in me. They are proud and shy, just\\nas we should be but if you REALLY want to be friends and don’t mind\\nrebuffs now and then, they come to trust and like you, and there is\\nso much to do for them one never need sit idle any more. I won’t\\ngive names, as they don’t like it, nor tell how I tried to serve\\nthem, but it is very sweet and good for me to have found this work,\\nand to know that each year I can do it better and better. So I feel\\nencouraged and am very glad I began, as I hope you all are. Now, who\\ncomes next?”\\n\\nAs Anna ended, the needles dropped and ten soft hands gave her a\\nhearty round of applause; for all felt that she had done well, and\\nchosen a task especially fitted to her powers, as she had money,\\ntime, tact, and the winning manners that make friends everywhere.\\n\\nBeaming with pleasure at their approval, but feeling that they made\\ntoo much of her small success, Anna called the club to order by\\nsaying, “Ella looks as if she were anxious to tell her experiences,\\nso perhaps we had better ask her to hold forth next.”\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried the girls; and, nothing loath, Ella promptly\\nbegan, with twinkling eyes and a demure smile, for HER story ended\\nromantically.\\n\\n“If you are interested in shop-girls, Miss President and ladies, you\\nwill like to know that _I_ am one, at least a silent partner and\\nco-worker in a small fancy store at the West End.”\\n\\n“No!” exclaimed the amazed club with one voice; and, satisfied with\\nthis sensational beginning Ella went on.\\n\\n“I really am, and you have bought some of my fancy-work. Isn’t that\\na good joke? You needn’t stare so, for I actually made that\\nneedle-book, Anna, and my partner knit Lizzie’s new cloud. This is\\nthe way it all happened. I didn’t wish to waste any time, but one\\ncan’t rush into the street and collar shabby little girls, and say,\\n‘Come along and learn to sew,’ without a struggle, so I thought I’d\\ngo and ask Mrs. Brown how to begin. Her branch of the Associated\\nCharities is in Laurel Street, not far from our house, you know; and\\nthe very day after our last meeting I posted off to get my ‘chore.’\\nI expected to have to fit work for poor needlewomen, or go to see\\nsome dreadful sick creature, or wash dirty little Pats, and was\\nbracing up my mind for whatever might come, as I toiled up the hill\\nin a gale of wind. Suddenly my hat flew off and went gayly skipping\\naway, to the great delight of some black imps, who only grinned and\\ncheered me on as I trotted after it with wild grabs and wrathful\\ndodges. I got it at last out of a puddle, and there I was in a nice\\nmess. The elastic was broken, feather wet, and the poor thing all\\nmud and dirt. I didn’t care much, as it was my old one,--dressed for\\nmy work, you see. But I couldn’t go home bareheaded, and I didn’t\\nknow a soul in that neighborhood. I turned to step into a grocery\\nstore at the corner, to borrow a brush or buy a sheet of paper to\\nwear, for I looked like a lunatic with my battered hat and my hair\\nin a perfect mop. Luckily I spied a woman’s fancy shop on the other\\ncorner, and rushed in there to hide myself, for the brats hooted and\\npeople stared. It was a very small shop, and behind the counter sat\\na tall, thin, washed-out-looking woman, making a baby’s hood. She\\nlooked poor and blue and rather sour, but took pity on me; and while\\nshe sewed the cord, dried the feather, and brushed off the dirt, I\\nwarmed myself and looked about to see what I could buy in return for\\nher trouble.\\n\\n“A few children’s aprons hung in the little window, with some knit\\nlace, balls, and old-fashioned garters, two or three dolls, and a\\nvery poor display of small wares. In a show-case, however, on the\\ntable that was the counter, I found some really pretty things, made\\nof plush, silk, and ribbon, with a good deal of taste. So I said I’d\\nbuy a needle-book, and a gay ball, and a pair of distracting baby’s\\nshoes, made to look like little open-work socks with pink\\nankle-ties, so cunning and dainty, I was glad to get them for Cousin\\nClara’s baby. The woman seemed pleased, though she had a grim way of\\ntalking, and never smiled once. I observed that she handled my hat\\nas if used to such work, and evidently liked to do it. I thanked her\\nfor repairing damages so quickly and well, and she said, with my hat\\non her hand, as if she hated to part with it, ‘I’m used to\\nmillineryin’ and never should have give it up, if I didn’t have my\\nfolks to see to. I took this shop, hopin’ to make things go, as such\\na place was needed round here, but mother broke down, and is a sight\\nof care; so I couldn’t leave her, and doctors is expensive, and\\ntimes hard, and I had to drop my trade, and fall back on pins and\\nneedles, and so on.’”\\n\\nElla was a capital mimic, and imitated the nasal tones of the\\nVermont woman to the life, with a doleful pucker of her own blooming\\nface, which gave such a truthful picture of poor Miss Almira Miller\\nthat those who had seen her recognized it at once, and laughed\\ngayly.\\n\\n“Just as I was murmuring a few words of regret at her bad luck,”\\n continued Ella, “a sharp voice called out from a back room, ‘Almiry!\\nAlmiry! come here.’ It sounded very like a cross parrot, but it was\\nthe old lady, and while I put on my hat I heard her asking who was\\nin the shop, and what we were ‘gabbin’ about.’ Her daughter told\\nher, and the old soul demanded to ‘see the gal;’ so I went in, being\\nready for fun as usual. It was a little, dark, dismal place, but as\\nneat as a pin, and in the bed sat a regular Grandma Smallweed\\nsmoking a pipe, with a big cap, a snuff-box, and a red cotton\\nhandkerchief. She was a tiny, dried-up thing, brown as a berry, with\\neyes like black beads, a nose and chin that nearly met, and hands\\nlike birds’ claws. But such a fierce, lively, curious, blunt old\\nlady you never saw, and I didn’t know what would be the end of me\\nwhen she began to question, then to scold, and finally to demand\\nthat ‘folks should come and trade to Almiry’s shop after promisin’\\nthey would, and she havin’ took a lease of the place on account of\\nthem lies.’ I wanted to laugh, but dared not do it, so just let her\\ncroak, for the daughter had to go to her customers. The old lady’s\\ntirade informed me that they came from Vermont, had ‘been wal on ‘t\\ntill father died and the farm was sold.’ Then it seems the women\\ncame to Boston and got on pretty well till ‘a stroke of numb-palsy,’\\nwhatever that is, made the mother helpless and kept Almiry at home\\nto care for her. I can’t tell you how funny and yet how sad it was\\nto see the poor old soul, so full of energy and yet so helpless, and\\nthe daughter so discouraged with her pathetic little shop and no\\ncustomers to speak of. I did not know what to say till ‘Grammer\\nMiller,’ as the children call her, happened to say, when she took up\\nher knitting after the lecture, ‘If folks who go spendin’ money\\nreckless on redic’lus toys for Christmas only knew what nice things,\\nuseful and fancy, me and Almiry could make ef we had the goods,\\nthey’d jest come round this corner and buy ‘em, and keep me out of a\\nOld Woman’s Home and that good, hard-workin’ gal of mine out of a\\n‘sylum; for go there she will ef she don’t get a boost somehow, with\\nrent and firin’ and vittles all on her shoulders, and me only able\\nto wag them knittin’-needles.’\\n\\n“‘I will buy things here, and tell all my friends about it, and I\\nhave a drawer full of pretty bits of silk and velvet and plush, that\\nI will give Miss Miller for her work, if she will let me.’ I added\\nthat, for I saw that Almiry was rather proud, and hid her troubles\\nunder a grim look.\\n\\n“That pleased the old lady, and, lowering her voice, she said, with\\na motherly sort of look in her beady eyes: ‘Seein’ as you are so\\nfriendly, I’ll tell you what frets me most, a layin’ here, a burden\\nto my darter. She kep’ company with Nathan Baxter, a master\\ncarpenter up to Westminster where we lived, and ef father hadn’t a\\ndied suddin’ they’d a ben married. They waited a number o’ years,\\nworkin’ to their trades, and we was hopin’ all would turn out wal,\\nwhen troubles come, and here we be. Nathan’s got his own folks to\\nsee to, and Almiry won’t add to HIS load with hern, nor leave me; so\\nshe give him back his ring, and jest buckled to all alone. She don’t\\nsay a word, but it’s wearin’ her to a shadder, and I can’t do a\\nthing to help, but make a few pinballs, knit garters, and kiver\\nholders. Ef she got a start in business it would cheer her up a\\nsight, and give her a kind of a hopeful prospeck, for old folks\\ncan’t live forever, and Nathan is a waitin’, faithful and true.’\\n\\n“That just finished me, for I am romantic, and do enjoy love stories\\nwith all my heart, even if the lovers are only a skinny spinster and\\na master carpenter. So I just resolved to see what I could do for\\npoor Almiry and the peppery old lady. I didn’t promise anything but\\nmy bits, and, taking the things I bought, went home to talk it over\\nwith Mamma. I found she had often got pins and tape, and such small\\nwares, at the little shop, and found it very convenient, though she\\nknew nothing about the Millers. She was willing I should help if I\\ncould, but advised going slowly, and seeing what they could do\\nfirst. We did not dare to treat them like beggars, and send them\\nmoney and clothes, and tea and sugar, as we do the Irish, for they\\nwere evidently respectable people, and proud as poor. So I took my\\nbundle of odds and ends, and Mamma added some nice large pieces of\\ndresses we had done with, and gave a fine order for aprons and\\nholders and balls for our church fair.\\n\\n“It would have done your hearts good, girls, to see those poor old\\nfaces light up as I showed my scraps, and asked if the work would be\\nready by Christmas. Grammer fairly swam in the gay colors I strewed\\nover her bed, and enjoyed them like a child, while Almiry tried to\\nbe grim, but had to give it up, as she began at once to cut out\\naprons, and dropped tears all over the muslin when her back was\\nturned to me. I didn’t know a washed-out old maid COULD be so\\npathetic.”\\n\\nElla stopped to give a regretful sigh over her past blindness, while\\nher hearers made a sympathetic murmur; for young hearts are very\\ntender, and take an innocent interest in lovers’ sorrows, no matter\\nhow humble.\\n\\n“Well, that was the beginning of it. I got so absorbed in making\\nthings go well that I didn’t look any further, but just ‘buckled to’\\nwith Miss Miller and helped run that little shop. No one knew me in\\nthat street, so I slipped in and out, and did what I liked. The old\\nlady and I got to be great friends; though she often pecked and\\ncroaked like a cross raven, and was very wearing. I kept her busy\\nwith her ‘pin-balls and knittin’-work, and supplied Almiry with\\npretty materials for the various things I found she could make. You\\nwouldn’t believe what dainty bows those long fingers could tie, what\\nravishing doll’s hats she would make out of a scrap of silk and\\nlace, or the ingenious things she concocted with cones and shells\\nand fans and baskets. I love such work, and used to go and help her\\noften, for I wanted her window and shop to be full for Christmas,\\nand lure in plenty of customers. Our new toys and the little cases\\nof sewing silk sold well, and people began to come more, after I\\nlent Almiry some money to lay in a stock of better goods. Papa\\nenjoyed my business venture immensely, and was never tired of joking\\nabout it. He actually went and bought balls for four small black\\nboys who were gluing their noses to the window one day, spellbound\\nby the orange, red, and blue treasures displayed there. He liked my\\npartner’s looks, though he teased me by saying that we’d better add\\nlemonade to our stock, as poor, dear Almiry’s acid face would make\\nlemons unnecessary, and sugar and water were cheap.\\n\\n“Well, Christmas came, and we did a great business, for Mamma came\\nand sent others, and our fancy things were as pretty and cheaper\\nthan those at the art stores, so they went well, and the Millers\\nwere cheered up, and I felt encouraged, and we took a fresh start\\nafter the holidays. One of my gifts at New Year was my own\\nglove-case,--you remember the apple-blossom thing I began last\\nautumn? I put it in our window to fill up, and Mamma bought it, and\\ngave it to me full of elegant gloves, with a sweet note, and Papa\\nsent a check to ‘Miller, Warren & Co.’ I was so pleased and proud I\\ncould hardly help telling you all. But the best joke was the day you\\ngirls came in and bought our goods, and I peeped at you through the\\ncrack of the door, being in the back room dying with laughter to see\\nyou look round, and praise our ‘nice assortment of useful and pretty\\narticles.’”\\n\\n“That’s all very well, and we can bear to be laughed at if you\\nsucceeded, Miss. But I don’t believe you did, for no Millers are\\nthere now. Have you taken a palatial store on Boylston Street for\\nthis year, intending to run it alone? We’ll all patronize it, and\\nyour name will look well on a sign,” said Maggie, wondering what the\\nend of Ella’s experience had been.\\n\\n“Ah! I still have the best of it, for my romance finished up\\ndelightfully, as you shall hear. We did well all winter, and no\\nwonder. What was needed was a little ‘boost’ in the right direction,\\nand I could give it; so my Millers were much comforted, and we were\\ngood friends. But in March Grammer died suddenly, and poor Almiry\\nmourned as if she had been the sweetest mother in the world. The old\\nlady’s last wishes were to be ‘laid out harnsome in a cap with a\\npale blue satin ribbin, white wasn’t becomin’, to hev at least three\\ncarriages to the funeral, and be sure a paper with her death in it\\nwas sent to N. Baxter, Westminster, Vermont.’\\n\\n“I faithfully obeyed her commands, put on the ugly cap myself, gave\\na party of old ladies from the home a drive in the hacks, and\\ncarefully directed a marked paper to Nathan, hoping that he HAD\\nproved ‘faithful and true.’ I didn’t expect he would, so was not\\nsurprised when no answer came. But I WAS rather amazed when Almiry\\ntold me she didn’t care to keep on with the store now she was free.\\nShe wanted to visit her friends a spell this spring, and in the fall\\nwould go back to her trade in some milliner’s store.\\n\\n“I was sorry, for I really enjoyed my partnership. It seemed a\\nlittle bit ungrateful after all my trouble in getting her customers,\\nbut I didn’t say anything, and we sold out to the Widow Bates, who\\nis a good soul with six children, and will profit by our efforts.\\n\\n“Almiry bid me good-by with all the grim look gone out of her face,\\nmany thanks, and a hearty promise to write soon. That was in April.\\nA week ago I got a short letter saying,--\\n\\n“‘DEAR FRIEND,--You will be pleased to hear that I am married to Mr.\\nBaxter, and shall remain here. He was away when the paper came with\\nmother’s death, but as soon as he got home he wrote. I couldn’t make\\nup my mind till I got home and see him. Now it’s all right, and I am\\nvery happy. Many thanks for all you done for me and mother. I shall\\nnever forget it My husband sends respects, and I remain Yours\\ngratefully, ALMIRA M. BAXTER.’”\\n\\n“That’s splendid! You did well, and next winter you can look up\\nanother sour spinster and cranky old lady and make them happy,” said\\nAnna, with the approving smile all loved to receive from her.\\n\\n“My adventures are not a bit romantic, or even interesting, and yet\\nI’ve been as busy as a bee all winter, and enjoyed my work very\\nmuch,” began Elizabeth, as the President gave her a nod.\\n\\n“The plan I had in mind was to go and carry books and papers to the\\npeople in hospitals, as one of Mamma’s friends has done for years. I\\nwent once to the City Hospital with her, and it was very\\ninteresting, but I didn’t dare to go to the grown people all alone,\\nso I went to the Children’s Hospital, and soon loved to help amuse\\nthe poor little dears. I saved all the picture-books and papers I\\ncould find for them, dressed dolls, and mended toys, and got new\\nones, and made bibs and night-gowns, and felt like the mother of a\\nlarge family.\\n\\n“I had my pets, of course, and did my best for them, reading and\\nsinging and amusing them, for many suffered very much. One little\\ngirl was so dreadfully burned she could not use her hands, and would\\nlie and look at a gay dolly tied to the bedpost by the hour\\ntogether, and talk to it and love it, and died with it on her pillow\\nwhen I ‘sung lullaby’ to her for the last time. I keep it among my\\ntreasures, for I learned a lesson in patience from little Norah that\\nI never can forget.\\n\\n“Then Jimmy Dolan with hip disease was a great delight to me, for he\\nwas as gay as a lark in spite of pain, and a real little hero in the\\nway he bore the hard things that had to be done to him. He never can\\nget well, and he is at home now; but I still see to him, and he is\\nlearning to make toy furniture very nicely, so that by and by, if he\\ngets able to work at all, he may be able to learn a cabinet-maker’s\\ntrade, or some easy work.\\n\\n“But my pet of pets was Johnny, the blind boy. His poor eyes had to\\nbe taken out, and there he was left so helpless and pathetic, all\\nhis life before him, and no one to help him, for his people were\\npoor and he had to go away from the hospital since he was incurable.\\nHe seemed almost given to me, for the first time I saw him I was\\nsinging to Jimmy, when the door opened and a small boy came fumbling\\nin.\\n\\n“‘I hear a pretty voice, I want to find it,’ he said, stopping as I\\nstopped with both hands out as if begging for more.\\n\\n“‘Come on. Johnny, and the lady will sing to you like a bobolink,’\\ncalled Jimmy, as proud as Barnum showing off Jumbo.\\n\\n“The poor little thing came and stood at my knee, without stirring,\\nwhile I sang all the nursery jingles I knew. Then he put such a thin\\nlittle finger on my lips as if to feel where the music came from,\\nand said, smiling all over his white face, ‘More, please more, lots\\nof ‘em! I love it!’\\n\\n“So I sang away till I was as hoarse as a crow, and Johnny drank it\\nall in like water; kept time with his head, stamped when I gave him\\n‘Marching through Georgia,’ and hurrahed feebly in the chorus of\\n‘Red, White, and Blue.’ It was lovely to see how he enjoyed it, and\\nI was so glad I had a voice to comfort those poor babies with. He\\ncried when I had to go, and so touched my heart that I asked all\\nabout him, and resolved to get him into the Blind School as the only\\nplace where he could be taught and made happy.”\\n\\n“I thought you were bound there the day I met you, Lizzie; but you\\nlooked as solemn as if all your friends had lost their sight,” cried\\nMarion.\\n\\n“I did feel solemn, for if Johnny could not go there he would be\\nbadly off. Fortunately he was ten, and dear Mrs. Russell helped me,\\nand those good people took him in though they were crowded. ‘We\\ncannot turn one away,’ said kind Mr. Parpatharges.\\n\\n“So there my boy is, as happy as a king with his little mates,\\nlearning all sorts of useful lessons and pretty plays. He models\\nnicely in clay. Here is one of his little works. Could you do as\\nwell without eyes?” and Lizzie proudly produced a very one-sided\\npear with a long straw for a stem. “I don’t expect he will ever be a\\nsculptor, but I hope he will do something with music he loves it so,\\nand is already piping away on a fife very cleverly. Whatever his\\ngift may prove, if he lives, he will be taught to be a useful,\\nindependent man, not a helpless burden, nor an unhappy creature\\nsitting alone in the dark. I feel very happy about my lads, and am\\nsurprised to find how well I get on with them. I shall look up some\\nmore next year, for I really think I have quite a gift that way,\\nthough you wouldn’t expect it, as I have no brothers, and always had\\na fancy boys were little imps.”\\n\\nThe girls were much amused at Lizzie’s discovery of her own powers,\\nfor she was a stately damsel, who never indulged in romps, but lived\\nfor her music. Now it was evident that she had found the key to\\nunlock childish hearts, and was learning to use it, quite\\nunconscious that the sweet voice she valued so highly was much\\nimproved by the tender tones singing lullabies gave it. The fat pear\\nwas passed round like refreshments, receiving much praise and no\\nharsh criticism; and when it was safely returned to its proud\\npossessor, Ida began her tale in a lively tone.\\n\\n“I waited for MY chore, and it came tumbling down our basement steps\\none rainy day in the shape of a large dilapidated umbrella with a\\npair of small boots below it. A mild howl made me run to open the\\ndoor, for I was at lunch in the dining-room, all alone, and rather\\nblue because I couldn’t go over to see Ella. A very small girl lay\\nwith her head in a puddle at the foot of the steps, the boots waving\\nin the air, and the umbrella brooding over her like a draggled green\\nbird.\\n\\n“‘Are you hurt, child?’ said I.\\n\\n“‘No, I thank you, ma’am,’ said the mite quite calmly, as she sat up\\nand settled a woman’s shabby black hat on her head.\\n\\n“‘Did you come begging?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘No, ma’am, I came for some things Mrs. Grover’s got for us. She\\ntold me to. I don’t beg.’ And up rose the sopping thing with great\\ndignity.\\n\\n“So I asked her to sit down, and ran up to call Mrs. Grover. She was\\nbusy with Grandpa just then, and when I went back to my lunch there\\nsat my lady with her arms folded, water dripping out of the toes of\\nher old boots as they hung down from the high chair, and the biggest\\nblue eyes I ever saw fixed upon the cake and oranges on the table. I\\ngave her a piece, and she sighed with rapture, but only picked at it\\ntill I asked if she didn’t like it.\\n\\n“‘Oh yes, ‘m, it’s elegant! Only I was wishin’ I could take it to\\nCaddy and Tot, if you didn’t mind. They never had frostin’ in all\\ntheir lives, and I did once.’\\n\\n“Of course I put up a little basket of cake and oranges and figs,\\nand while Lotty feasted, we talked. I found that their mother washed\\ndishes all day in a restaurant over by the Albany Station, leaving\\nthe three children alone in the room they have on Berry Street.\\nThink of that poor thing going off before light these winter\\nmornings to stand over horrid dishes all day long, and those three\\nscraps of children alone till night! Sometimes they had a fire, and\\nwhen they hadn’t they stayed in bed. Broken food and four dollars a\\nweek was all the woman got, and on that they tried to live. Good\\nMrs. Grover happened to be nursing a poor soul near Berry Street\\nlast summer, and used to see the three little things trailing round\\nthe streets with no one to look after them.\\n\\n“Lotty is nine, though she looks about six, but is as old as most\\ngirls of fourteen, and takes good care of ‘the babies,’ as she calls\\nthe younger ones. Mrs. Grover went to see them, and, though a\\nhard-working creature, did all she could for them. This winter she\\nhas plenty of time to sew, for Grandpapa needs little done for him\\nexcept at night and morning, and that kind woman spent her own\\nmoney, and got warm flannel and cotton and stuff, and made each\\nchild a good suit. Lotty had come for hers, and when the bundle was\\nin her arms she hugged it close, and put up her little face to kiss\\nGrover so prettily, I felt that I wanted to do something too. So I\\nhunted up Min’s old waterproof and rubbers, and a hood, and sent\\nLotty home as happy as a queen, promising to go and see her. I did\\ngo, and there was my work all ready for me. Oh, girls! such a bare,\\ncold room, without a spark of fire, and no food but a pan of bits of\\npie and bread and meat, not fit for any one to eat, and in the bed,\\nwith an old carpet for cover, lay the three children. Tot and Caddy\\ncuddled in the warmest place, while Lotty, with her little blue\\nhands, was trying to patch up some old stockings with bits of\\ncotton. I didn’t know how to begin, but Lotty did, and I just took\\nher orders; for that wise little woman told me where to buy a bushel\\nof coal and some kindlings, and milk and meal, and all I wanted. I\\nworked like a beaver for an hour or two, and was so glad I’d been to\\na cooking-class, for I could make a fire, with Lotty to do the\\ngrubby part, and start a nice soup with the cold meat and potatoes,\\nand an onion or so. Soon the room was warm, and full of a nice\\nsmell, and out of bed tumbled ‘the babies,’ to dance round the stove\\nand sniff at the soup, and drink milk like hungry kittens, till I\\ncould get bread and butter ready.\\n\\n“It was great fun! and when we had cleared things up a bit, and I’d\\nput food for supper in the closet, and told Lotty to warm a bowl of\\nsoup for her mother and keep the fire going, I went home tired and\\ndirty, but very glad I’d found something to do. It is perfectly\\namazing how little poor people’s things cost, and yet they can’t get\\nthe small amount of money needed without working themselves to\\ndeath. Why, all I bought didn’t cost more than I often spend for\\nflowers, or theatre tickets, or lunches, and it made those poor\\nbabies so comfortable I could have cried to think I’d never done it\\nbefore.”\\n\\nIda paused to shake her head remorsefully, then went on with her\\nstory, sewing busily all the while on an unbleached cotton\\nnight-gown which looked about fit for a large doll.\\n\\n“I have no romantic things to tell, for poor Mrs. Kennedy was a\\nshiftless, broken-down woman, who could only ‘sozzle round,’ as Mrs.\\nGrover said, and rub along with help from any one who would lend a\\nhand. She had lived out, married young, and had no faculty about\\nanything; so when her husband died, and she was left with three\\nlittle children, it was hard to get on, with no trade, feeble\\nhealth, and a discouraged mind. She does her best, loves the girls,\\nand works hard at the only thing she can find to do; but when she\\ngives out, they will all have to part,--she to a hospital, and the\\nbabies to some home. She dreads that, and tugs away, trying to keep\\ntogether and get ahead. Thanks to Mrs. Grover, who is very sensible,\\nand knows how to help poor people, we have made things comfortable,\\nand the winter has gone nicely.\\n\\n“The mother has got work nearer home, Lotty and Caddy go to school,\\nand Tot is safe and warm, with Miss Parsons to look after her. Miss\\nParsons is a young woman who was freezing and starving in a little\\nroom upstairs, too proud to beg and too shy and sick to get much\\nwork. I found her warming her hands one day in Mrs. Kennedy’s room,\\nand hanging over the soup-pot as if she was eating the smell. It\\nreminded me of the picture in Punch where the two beggar boys look\\nin at a kitchen, sniffing at the nice dinner cooking there. One\\nsays, ‘I don’t care for the meat, Bill, but I don’t mind if I takes\\na smell at the pudd’n’ when it’s dished.’ I proposed a lunch at\\nonce, and we all sat down, and ate soup out of yellow bowls with\\npewter spoons with such a relish it was fun to see. I had on my old\\nrig; so poor Parsons thought I was some dressmaker or work-girl, and\\nopened her heart to me as she never would have done if I’d gone and\\ndemanded her confidence, and patronized her, as some people do when\\nthey want to help. I promised her some work, and proposed that she\\nshould do it in Mrs. K.’s room, as a favor, mind you, so that the\\nolder girls could go to school and Tot have some one to look after\\nher. She agreed, and that saved her fire, and made the K.’s all\\nright. Sarah (that’s Miss P.) tried to stiffen up when she learned\\nwhere I lived; but she wanted the work, and soon found I didn’t put\\non airs, but lent her books, and brought her and Tot my bouquets and\\nfavors after a german, and told her pleasant things as she sat\\ncooking her poor chilblainy feet in the oven, as if she never could\\nget thawed out.\\n\\n“This summer the whole batch are to go to Uncle Frank’s farm and\\npick berries, and get strong. He hires dozens of women and children\\nduring the fruit season, and Mrs. Grover said it was just what they\\nall needed. So off they go in June, as merry as grigs, and I shall\\nbe able to look after them now and then, as I always go to the farm\\nin July. That’s all,--not a bit interesting, but it came to me, and\\nI did it, though only a small chore.”\\n\\n“I’m sure the helping of five poor souls is a fine work, and you may\\nwell be proud of it, Ida. Now I know why you wouldn’t go to matinees\\nwith me, and buy every pretty thing we saw as you used to. The\\npocket money went for coal and food, and your fancy work was little\\nclothes for these live dolls of yours. You dear thing! how good you\\nwere to cook, and grub, and prick your fingers rough, and give up\\nfun, for this kind work!”\\n\\nMaggie’s hearty kiss, and the faces of her friends, made Ida feel\\nthat her humble task had its worth in their eyes, as well as in her\\nown; and when the others had expressed their interest in her work,\\nall composed themselves to hear what Marion had to tell.\\n\\n“I have been taking care of a scarlet runner,--a poor old\\nfrost-bitten, neglected thing; it is transplanted now, and doing\\nwell, I’m happy to say.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Ella, while the rest looked very curious.\\n\\nMarion picked up a dropped stitch in the large blue sock she was\\nknitting, and continued, with a laugh in her eyes: “My dears, that\\nis what we call the Soldiers’ Messenger Corps, with their red caps\\nand busy legs trotting all day. I’ve had one of them to care for,\\nand a gorgeous time of it, I do assure you. But before I exult over\\nmy success, I must honestly confess my failures, for they were sad\\nones. I was so anxious to begin my work at once, that I did go out\\nand collar the first pauper I saw. It was an old man, who sometimes\\nstands at the corners of streets to sell bunches of ugly paper\\nflowers. You’ve seen him, I dare say, and his magenta daisies and\\nyellow peonies. Well, he was rather a forlorn object, with his poor\\nold red nose, and bleary eyes, and white hair, standing at the windy\\ncorners silently holding out those horrid flowers. I bought all he\\nhad that day, and gave them to some colored children on my way home,\\nand told him to come to our house and get an old coat Mamma was\\nwaiting to get rid of. He told a pitiful story of himself and his\\nold wife, who made the paper horrors in her bed, and how they needed\\neverything, but didn’t wish to beg. I was much touched, and flew\\nhome to look up the coat and some shoes, and when my old Lear came\\ncreeping in the back way, I ordered cook to give him a warm dinner\\nand something nice for the old woman.\\n\\n“I was called upstairs while he was mumbling his food, and blessing\\nme in the most lovely manner; and he went away much comforted, I\\nflattered myself. But an hour later, up came the cook in a great\\npanic to report that my venerable and pious beggar had carried off\\nseveral of Papa’s shirts and pairs of socks out of the clothes-basket\\nin the laundry, and the nice warm hood we keep for the girl to hang\\nout clothes in.\\n\\n“I was VERY angry, and, taking Harry with me, went at once to the\\naddress the old rascal gave me, a dirty court out of Hanover Street\\nNo such person had ever lived there, and my white-haired saint was a\\nhumbug. Harry laughed at me, and Mamma forbade me to bring any more\\nthieves to the house, and the girls scolded awfully.\\n\\n“Well, I recovered from the shock, and, nothing daunted, went off to\\nthe little Irishwoman who sells apples on the Common,--not the fat,\\ntosey one with the stall near West Street, but the dried-up one who\\nsits by the path, nodding over an old basket with six apples and\\nfour sticks of candy in it. No one ever seems to buy anything, but\\nshe sits there and trusts to kind souls dropping a dime now and\\nthen; she looks so feeble and forlorn, ‘on the cold, cold ground.’\\n\\n“She told me another sad tale of being all alone and unable to work,\\nand ‘as wake as wather-grewl, without a hap-worth av flesh upon me\\nbones, and for the love of Heaven gimme a thrifle to kape the breath\\nav loife in a poor soul, with a bitter hard winter over me, and\\nniver a chick or child to do a hand’s turn.’ I hadn’t much faith in\\nher, remembering my other humbug, but I did pity the old mummy; so I\\ngot some tea and sugar, and a shawl, and used to give her my odd\\npennies as I passed. I never told at home, they made such fun of my\\nefforts to be charitable. I thought I really was getting on pretty\\nwell after a time, as my old Biddy seemed quite cheered up, and I\\nwas planning to give her some coal, when she disappeared all of a\\nsudden. I feared she was ill, and asked Mrs. Maloney, the fat woman,\\nabout her.\\n\\n“‘Lord love ye, Miss dear, it’s tuk up and sint to the Island for\\ntree months she is; for a drunken ould crayther is Biddy Ryan, and\\nniver a cint but goes for whiskey,--more shame to her, wid a fine\\nbye av her own ready to kape her daycint.’\\n\\n“Then I WAS discouraged, and went home to fold my hands, and see\\nwhat fate would send me, my own efforts being such failures.”\\n\\n“Poor thing, it WAS hard luck!” said Elizabeth, as they sobered down\\nafter the gale of merriment caused by Marion’s mishaps, and her\\nclever imitation of the brogue.\\n\\n“Now tell of your success, and the scarlet runner,” added Maggie.\\n\\n“Ah! that was SENT, and so I prospered. I must begin ever so far\\nback, in war times, or I can’t introduce my hero properly. You know\\nPapa was in the army, and fought all through the war till\\nGettysburg, where he was wounded. He was engaged just before he\\nwent; so when his father hurried to him after that awful battle,\\nMamma went also, and helped nurse him till he could come home. He\\nwouldn’t go to an officer’s hospital, but kept with his men in a\\npoor sort of place, for many of his boys were hit, and he wouldn’t\\nleave them. Sergeant Joe Collins was one of the bravest, and lost\\nhis right arm saving the flag in one of the hottest struggles of\\nthat great fight. He had been a Maine lumberman, and was over six\\nfeet tall, but as gentle as a child, and as jolly as a boy, and very\\nfond of his colonel.\\n\\n“Papa left first, but made Joe promise to let him know how he got\\non, and Joe did so till he too went home. Then Papa lost sight of\\nhim, and in the excitement of his own illness, and the end of the\\nwar, and being married, Joe Collins was forgotten, till we children\\ncame along, and used to love to hear the story of Papa’s battles,\\nand how the brave sergeant caught the flag when the bearer was shot,\\nand held it in the rush till one arm was blown off and the other\\nwounded. We have fighting blood in us, you know, so we were never\\ntired of that story, though twenty-five years or more make it all\\nas far away to us as the old Revolution, where OUR ancestor was\\nkilled, at OUR Bunker Hill!\\n\\n“Last December, just after my sad disappointments, Papa came home to\\ndinner one day, exclaiming, in great glee: ‘I’ve found old Joe! A\\nmessenger came with a letter to me, and when I looked up to give my\\nanswer, there stood a tall, grizzled fellow, as straight as a\\nramrod, grinning from ear to ear, with his hand to his temple,\\nsaluting me in regular style. “Don’t you remember Joe Collins,\\nColonel? Awful glad to see you, sir,” said he. And then it all came\\nback, and we had a good talk, and I found out that the poor old boy\\nwas down on his luck, and almost friendless, but as proud and\\nindependent as ever, and bound to take care of himself while he had\\na leg to stand on. I’ve got his address, and mean to keep an eye on\\nhim, for he looks feeble and can’t make much, I’m sure.’\\n\\n“We were all very glad, and Joe came to see us, and Papa sent him on\\nendless errands, and helped him in that way till he went to New\\nYork. Then, in the fun and flurry of the holidays, we forgot all\\nabout Joe, till Papa came home and missed him from his post. I said\\nI’d go and find him; so Harry and I rummaged about till we did find\\nhim, in a little house at the North End, laid up with rheumatic\\nfever in a stuffy back room, with no one to look after him but the\\nwasherwoman with whom he boarded.\\n\\n“I was SO sorry we had forgotten him! but HE never complained, only\\nsaid, with his cheerful grin,’ I kinder mistrusted the Colonel was\\naway, but I wasn’t goin’ to pester him.’ He tried to be jolly,\\nthough in dreadful pain; called Harry ‘Major,’ and was so grateful\\nfor all we brought him, though he didn’t want oranges and tea, and\\nmade us shout when I said, like a goose, thinking that was the\\nproper thing to do, ‘Shall I bathe your brow, you are so feverish?’\\n\\n“‘No, thanky, miss, it was swabbed pretty stiddy to the horsepittle,\\nand I reckon a trifle of tobaccer would do more good and be a sight\\nmore relishin’, ef you’ll excuse my mentionin’ it.’\\n\\n“Harry rushed off and got a great lump and a pipe, and Joe lay\\nblissfully puffing, in a cloud of smoke, when we left him, promising\\nto come again. We did go nearly every day, and had lovely times; for\\nJoe told us his adventures, and we got so interested in the war that\\nI began to read up evenings, and Papa was pleased, and fought all\\nhis battles over again for us, and Harry and I were great friends\\nreading together, and Papa was charmed to see the old General’s\\nspirit in us, as we got excited and discussed all our wars in a\\nfever of patriotism that made Mamma laugh. Joe said I ‘brustled up’\\nat the word BATTLE like a war-horse at the smell of powder, and I’d\\nought to have been a drummer, the sound of martial music made me so\\n‘skittish.’\\n\\n“It was all new and charming to us young ones, but poor old Joe had\\na hard time, and was very ill. Exposure and fatigue, and scanty\\nfood, and loneliness, and his wounds, were too much for him, and it\\nwas plain his working days were over. He hated the thought of the\\npoor-house at home, which was all his own town could offer him, and\\nhe had no friends to live with, and he could not get a pension,\\nsomething being wrong about his papers; so he would have been badly\\noff, but for the Soldiers’ Home at Chelsea. As soon as he was able,\\nPapa got him in there, and he was glad to go, for that seemed the\\nproper place, and a charity the proudest man might accept, after\\nrisking his life for his country.\\n\\n“There is where I used to be going when you saw me, and I was SO\\nafraid you’d smell the cigars in my basket. The dear old boys always\\nwant them, and Papa says they MUST have them, though it isn’t half\\nso romantic as flowers, and jelly, and wine, and the dainty messes\\nwe women always want to carry. I’ve learned about different kinds of\\ntobacco and cigars, and you’d laugh to see me deal out my gifts,\\nwhich are received as gratefully as the Victoria Cross, when the\\nQueen decorates HER brave men. I’m quite a great gun over there, and\\nthe boys salute when I come, tell me their woes, and think that Papa\\nand I can run the whole concern. I like it immensely, and am as\\nproud and fond of my dear old wrecks as if I’d been a Rigoletto, and\\nridden on a cannon from my babyhood. That’s MY story, but I can’t\\nbegin to tell how interesting it all is, nor how glad I am that it\\nled me to look into the history of American wars, in which brave men\\nof our name did their parts so well.”\\n\\nA hearty round of applause greeted Marion’s tale, for her glowing\\nface and excited voice stirred the patriotic spirit of the Boston\\ngirls, and made them beam approvingly upon her.\\n\\n“Now, Maggie, dear, last but not least, I’m sure,” said Anna, with\\nan encouraging glance, for SHE had discovered the secret of this\\nfriend, and loved her more than ever for it.\\n\\nMaggie blushed and hesitated, as she put down the delicate muslin\\ncap-strings she was hemming with such care. Then, looking about her\\nwith a face in which both humility and pride contended, she said\\nwith an effort, “After the other lively experiences, mine will sound\\nvery flat. In fact, I have no story to tell, for MY charity began at\\nhome, and stopped there.”\\n\\n“Tell it, dear. I know it is interesting, and will do us all good,”\\n said Anna, quickly; and, thus supported, Maggie went on.\\n\\n“I planned great things, and talked about what I meant to do, till\\nPapa said one day, when things were in a mess, as they often are at\\nour house, ‘If the little girls who want to help the world along\\nwould remember that charity begins at home, they would soon find\\nenough to do.’\\n\\n“I was rather taken aback, and said no more, but after Papa had gone\\nto the office, I began to think, and looked round to see what there\\nwas to be done at that particular moment. I found enough for that\\nday, and took hold at once; for poor Mamma had one of her bad\\nheadaches, the children could not go out because it rained, and so\\nwere howling in the nursery, cook was on a rampage, and Maria had\\nthe toothache. Well, I began by making Mamma lie down for a good\\nlong sleep. I kept the children quiet by giving them my ribbon box\\nand jewelry to dress up with, put a poultice on Maria’s face, and\\noffered to wash the glass and silver for her, to appease cook, who\\nwas as cross as two sticks over extra work washing-day. It wasn’t\\nmuch fun, as you may imagine, but I got through the afternoon, and\\nkept the house still, and at dusk crept into Mamma’s room and softly\\nbuilt up the fire, so it should be cheery when she waked. Then I\\nwent trembling to the kitchen for some tea, and there found three\\ngirls calling, and high jinks going on; for one whisked a plate of\\ncake into the table drawer, another put a cup under her shawl, and\\ncook hid the teapot, as I stirred round in the china closet before\\nopening the slide, through a crack of which I’d seen, heard, and\\nsmelt ‘the party,’ as the children call it.\\n\\n“I was angry enough to scold the whole set, but I wisely held my\\ntongue, shut my eyes, and politely asked for some hot water, nodded\\nto the guests, and told cook Maria was better, and would do her work\\nif she wanted to go out.\\n\\n“So peace reigned, and as I settled the tray, I heard cook say in\\nher balmiest tone, for I suspect the cake and tea lay heavy on her\\nconscience, ‘The mistress is very poorly, and Miss takes nice care\\nof her, the dear.’\\n\\n“All blarney, but it pleased me and made me remember how feeble poor\\nMamma was, and how little I really did. So I wept a repentant weep\\nas I toiled upstairs with my tea and toast, and found Mamma all\\nready for them, and so pleased to find things going well. I saw by\\nthat what a relief it would be to her if I did it oftener, as I\\nought, and as I resolved that I would.\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything, but I kept on doing whatever came along, and\\nbefore I knew it ever so many duties slipped out of Mamma’s hands\\ninto mine, and seemed to belong to me. I don’t mean that I liked\\nthem, and didn’t grumble to myself; I did, and felt regularly\\ncrushed and injured sometimes when I wanted to go and have my own\\nfun. Duty is right, but it isn’t easy, and the only comfort about it\\nis a sort of quiet feeling you get after a while, and a strong\\nfeeling, as if you’d found something to hold on to and keep you\\nsteady. I can’t express it, but you know?” And Maggie looked\\nwistfully at the other faces, some of which answered her with a\\nquick flash of sympathy, and some only wore a puzzled yet respectful\\nexpression, as if they felt they ought to know, but did not.\\n\\n“I need not tire you with all my humdrum doings,” continued Maggie.\\n“I made no plans, but just said each day, ‘I’ll take what comes,\\nand try to be cheerful and contented.’ So I looked after the\\nchildren, and that left Maria more time to sew and help round. I did\\nerrands, and went to market, and saw that Papa had his meals\\ncomfortably when Mamma was not able to come down. I made calls for\\nher, and received visitors, and soon went on as if I were the lady\\nof the house, not ‘a chit of a girl,’ as Cousin Tom used to call me.\\n\\n“The best of all were the cosey talks we had in the twilight, Mamma\\nand I, when she was rested, and all the day’s worry was over, and we\\nwere waiting for Papa. Now, when he came, I didn’t have to go away,\\nfor they wanted to ask and tell me things, and consult about\\naffairs, and make me feel that I was really the eldest daughter. Oh,\\nit was just lovely to sit between them and know that they needed me,\\nand loved to have me with them! That made up for the hard and\\ndisagreeable things, and not long ago I got my reward. Mamma is\\nbetter, and I was rejoicing over it, when she said,’ Yes, I really\\nam mending now, and hope soon to be able to relieve my good girl.\\nBut I want to tell you, dear, that when I was most discouraged my\\ngreatest comfort was, that if I had to leave my poor babies they\\nwould find such a faithful little mother in you.’\\n\\n“I was SO pleased I wanted to cry, for the children DO love me, and\\nrun to me for everything now, and think the world of Sister, and\\nthey didn’t use to care much for me. But that wasn’t all. I ought\\nnot to tell these things, perhaps, but I’m so proud of them I can’t\\nhelp it. When I asked Papa privately, if Mamma was REALLY better and\\nin no danger of falling ill again, he said, with his arms round me,\\nand such a tender kiss,--\\n\\n“‘No danger now, for this brave little girl put her shoulder to the\\nwheel so splendidly, that the dear woman got the relief from care\\nshe needed just at the right time, and now she really rests sure\\nthat we are not neglected. You couldn’t have devoted yourself to a\\nbetter charity, or done it more sweetly, my darling. God bless\\nyou!’”\\n\\nHere Maggie’s voice gave out, and she hid her face, with a happy\\nsob, that finished her story eloquently. Marion flew to wipe her\\ntears away with the blue sock, and the others gave a sympathetic\\nmurmur, looking much touched; forgotten duties of their own rose\\nbefore them, and sudden resolutions were made to attend to them at\\nonce, seeing how great Maggie’s reward had been.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be silly; but I wanted you to know that I hadn’t\\nbeen idle all winter, and that, though I haven’t much to tell, I’m\\nquite satisfied with my chore,” she said, looking up with smiles\\nshining through the tears till her face resembled a rose in a\\nsun-shower.\\n\\n“Many daughters have done well, but thou excellest them all,”\\n answered Anna, with a kiss that completed her satisfaction.\\n\\n“Now, as it is after our usual time, and we must break up,”\\n continued the President, producing a basket of flowers from its\\nhiding-place, “I will merely say that I think we have all learned a\\ngood deal, and will be able to work better next winter; for I am\\nsure we shall want to try again, it adds so much sweetness to our\\nown lives to put even a little comfort into the hard lives of the\\npoor. As a farewell token, I sent for some real Plymouth mayflowers,\\nand here they are, a posy apiece, with my love and many thanks for\\nyour help in carrying out my plan so beautifully.”\\n\\nSo the nosegays were bestowed, the last lively chat enjoyed, new\\nplans suggested, and goodbyes said; then the club separated, each\\nmember going gayly away with the rosy flowers on her bosom, and in\\nit a clearer knowledge of the sad side of life, a fresh desire to\\nsee and help still more, and a sweet satisfaction in the thought\\nthat each had done what she could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN IVY SPRAY AND LADIES’ SLIPPERS\\n\\n\\n“IT can’t be done! So I may as well give it I up and get a new pair.\\nI long for them, but I’m afraid my nice little plan for Laura will\\nbe spoilt,” said Jessie Delano to herself, as she shook her head\\nover a pair of small, dilapidated slippers almost past mending.\\nWhile she vainly pricked her fingers over them for the last time,\\nher mind was full of girlish hopes and fears, as well as of\\nanxieties far too serious for a light-hearted creature of sixteen.\\n\\nA year ago the sisters had been the petted daughters of a rich man;\\nbut death and misfortune came suddenly, and now they were left to\\nface poverty alone. They had few relations, and had offended the\\nrich uncle who offered Jessie a home, because she refused to be\\nseparated from her sister. Poor Laura was an invalid, and no one\\nwanted her; but Jessie would not leave her, so they clung together\\nand lived on in the humble rooms where their father died, trying to\\nearn their bread by the only accomplishments they possessed. Laura\\npainted well, and after many disappointments was beginning to find a\\nsale for her dainty designs and delicate flowers. Jessie had a\\nnatural gift for dancing; and her former teacher, a kind-hearted\\nFrenchwoman, offered her favorite pupil the post of assistant\\nteacher in her classes for children.\\n\\nIt cost the girl a struggle to accept a place of this sort and be a\\nhumble teacher, patiently twirling stupid little boys and girls\\nround and round over the smooth floor where she used to dance so\\nhappily when she was the pride of the class and the queen of the\\nclosing balls. But for Laura’s sake she gratefully accepted the\\noffer, glad to add her mite to their small store, and to feel that\\nshe could help keep the wolf from the door. They had seemed to hear\\nthe howl of this dreaded phantom more than once during that year,\\nand looked forward to the long hard winter with an anxiety which\\nneither would confess to the other. Laura feared to fall ill if she\\nworked too hard, and then what would become of this pretty young\\nsister who loved her so tenderly and would not be tempted to leave\\nher? And Jessie could do very little except rebel against their hard\\nfate and make impracticable plans. But each worked bravely, talked\\ncheerfully, and waited hopefully for some good fortune to befall\\nthem, while doubt and pain and poverty and care made the young\\nhearts so heavy that the poor girls often fell asleep on pillows wet\\nwith secret tears.\\n\\nThe smaller trials of life beset Jessie at this particular moment,\\nand her bright wits were trying to solve the problem how to spend\\nher treasured five dollars on slippers for herself and paints for\\nLaura. Both were much needed, and she had gone in shabby shoes to\\nsave up money for the little surprise on which she had set her\\nheart; but now dismay fell upon her when the holes refused to be\\ncobbled, and the largest of bows would not hide the worn-out toes in\\nspite of ink and blacking lavishly applied.\\n\\n“These are the last of my dear French slippers, and I can’t afford\\nany more. I hate cheap things! But I shall have to get them; for my\\nboots are shabby, and every one has to look at my feet when I lead.\\nOh dear, what a horrid thing it is to be poor!” and Jessie surveyed\\nthe shabby little shoes affectionately, as her eyes filled with\\ntears; for the road looked very rough and steep now, when she\\nremembered how she used to dance through life as happy as a\\nbutterfly in a garden full of sunshine and flowers.\\n\\n“Now, Jess, no nonsense, no red eyes to tell tales! Go and do your\\nerrands, and come in as gay as a lark, or Laura will be worried.”\\n And springing up, the girl began to sing instead of sob, as she\\nstirred about her dismal little room, cleaning her old gloves,\\nmending her one white dress, and wishing with a sigh of intense\\nlonging that she could afford some flowers to wear, every ornament\\nhaving been sold long ago. Then, with a kiss and a smile to her\\npatient sister, she hurried away to get the necessary slippers and\\nthe much-desired paints, which Laura would not ask for, though her\\nwork waited for want of them.\\n\\nHaving been reared in luxury, poor little Jessie’s tastes were all\\nof the daintiest sort; and her hardest trial, after Laura’s feeble\\nhealth, was the daily sacrifice of the many comforts and elegances\\nto which she had been accustomed. Faded gowns, cleaned gloves, and\\nmended boots cost her many a pang, and the constant temptation of\\nseeing pretty, useful, and unattainable things was a very hard one.\\nLaura rarely went out, and so was spared this cross; then she was\\nthree years older, had always been delicate, and lived much in a\\nhappy world of her own. So Jessie bore her trials silently, but\\nsometimes felt very covetous and resentful to see so much pleasure,\\nmoney, and beauty in the world, and yet have so little of it fall to\\nher lot.\\n\\n“I feel as if I could pick a pocket to-day and not mind a bit, if it\\nwere a rich person’s. It’s a shame, when papa was always so\\ngenerous, that no one remembers us. If ever I’m rich again, I’ll\\njust hunt up all the poor girls I can find, and give them nice\\nshoes, if nothing else,” she thought, as she went along the crowded\\nstreets, pausing involuntarily at the shop windows to look with\\nlonging eyes at the treasures within.\\n\\nResisting the allurements of French slippers with bows and buckles,\\nshe wisely bought a plain, serviceable pair, and trudged away,\\nfinding balm for her wounds in the fact that they were very cheap.\\nMore balm came when she met a young friend, who joined her as she\\nstood wistfully eying the piles of grapes in a window and longing to\\nbuy some for Laura.\\n\\nThis warm-hearted schoolmate read the wish before Jessie saw her,\\nand gratified it so adroitly that the girl could accept the pretty\\nbasketful sent to her sister without feeling like a spendthrift or a\\nbeggar. It comforted her very much, and the world began to look\\nbrighter after that little touch of kindness, as it always does when\\ngenuine sympathy makes sunshine in shady places.\\n\\nAt the art store she was told that more of Laura’s autumn-flowers\\nwere in demand; and her face was so full of innocent delight and\\ngratitude it quite touched the old man who sold her the paints, and\\ngave her more than her money’s worth, remembering his own hard times\\nand pitying the pretty young girl whose father he had known.\\n\\nSo Jessie did not have to pretend very hard at being “as gay as a\\nlark” when she got home and showed her treasures. Laura was so happy\\nover the unexpected gifts that the dinner of bread and milk and\\ngrapes was quite a picnic; and Jessie found a smile on her face when\\nshe went to dress for her party.\\n\\nIt was only a child’s party at the house of one of Mademoiselle’s\\npupils, and Jessie was merely invited to help the little people\\nthrough their dancing. She did not like to go in this way, as she\\nwas sure to meet familiar faces there, full of the pity, curiosity,\\nor indifference so hard for a girl to bear. But Mademoiselle asked\\nit as a favor, and Jessie was grateful; so she went, expecting no\\npleasure and certain of much weariness, if not annoyance.\\n\\nWhen she was ready,--and it did not take long to slip on the white\\nwoollen dress, brush out the curly dark hair, and fold up slippers\\nand gloves,--she stood before her glass looking at herself, quite\\nconscious that she was very pretty, with her large eyes, blooming\\ncheeks, and the lofty little air which nothing could change. She was\\nalso painfully conscious that her dress was neither fresh nor\\nbecoming without a bit of ribbon or a knot of flowers to give it the\\ntouch of color it needed. She had an artistic eye, and used to\\ndelight in ordering charming costumes for herself in the happy days\\nwhen all her wishes were granted as if fairies still lived. She\\ntossed over her very small store of ribbons in vain; everything had\\nbeen worn till neither beauty nor freshness remained.\\n\\n“Oh dear! where CAN I find something to make me look less like a\\nnun,--and a very shabby one, too?” she said, longing for the pink\\ncorals she sold to pay Laura’s doctor’s bill.\\n\\nThe sound of a soft tap, tap, tap, startled her, and she ran to open\\nthe door. No one was there but Laura, fast asleep on the sofa. Tap,\\ntap, tap! went the invisible hand; and as the sound seemed to come\\nfrom the window, Jessie glanced that way, thinking her tame dove had\\ncome to be fed. Neither hungry dove nor bold sparrow appeared,--only\\na spray of Japanese ivy waving in the wind. A very pretty spray it\\nwas, covered with tiny crimson leaves; and it tapped impatiently, as\\nif it answered her question by saying, “Here is a garland for you;\\ncome and take it.”\\n\\nJessie’s quick eye was caught at once by the fine color, and running\\nto the window she looked out as eagerly as if a new idea had come\\ninto her head. It was a dull November day, and the prospect of\\nsheds, ash-barrels, and old brooms was a gloomy one; but the whole\\nback of the house glowed with the red tendrils of the hardy vine\\nthat clung to and covered the dingy bricks with a royal mantle, as\\nif eager to cheer the eyes and hearts of all who looked. It preached\\na little sermon of courage, aspiration, and content to those who had\\nthe skill to read it, and bade them see how, springing from the\\nscanty soil of that back yard full of the commonest objects, the\\nhumblest work, it set its little creepers in the crannies of the\\nstone, and struggled up to find the sun and air, till it grew strong\\nand beautiful,--making the blank wall green in summer, glorious in\\nautumn, and a refuge in winter, when it welcomed the sparrows to the\\nshelter of its branches where the sun lay warmest.\\n\\nJessie loved this beautiful neighbor, and had enjoyed it all that\\nsummer,--the first she ever spent in the hot city. She felt the\\ngrace its greenness gave to all it touched, and half unconsciously\\nimitated it in trying to be brave and bright, as she also climbed up\\nfrom the dismal place where she seemed shut away from everything\\nlovely, till she was beginning to discover that the blue sky was\\nover all, the sun still shone for her, and heaven’s fresh air kissed\\nher cheeks as kindly as ever. Many a night she had leaned from the\\nhigh window when Laura was asleep, dreaming innocent dreams, living\\nover her short past, or trying to look into the future bravely and\\ntrustfully. The little vine had felt warmer drops than rain or dew\\nfall on it when things went badly, had heard whispered prayers when\\nthe lonely child asked the Father of the fatherless for help and\\ncomfort, had peeped in to see her sleeping peacefully when the hard\\nhour was over, and been the first to greet her with a tap on the\\nwindow-pane as she woke full of new hope in the morning. It seemed\\nto know all her moods and troubles, to be her friend and confidante,\\nand now came with help like a fairy godmother when our Cinderella\\nwanted to be fine for the little ball.\\n\\n“Just the thing! Why didn’t I think of it? So bright and delicate\\nand becoming? It will last better than flowers; and no one can think\\nI’m extravagant, since it costs nothing.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Jessie was gathering long sprays of the rosy vine,\\nwith its glossy leaves so beautifully shaded that it was evident\\nJack Frost had done his best for it. Going to her glass, she\\nfastened a wreath of the smallest leaves about her head, set a\\ncluster of larger ones in her bosom, and then surveyed herself with\\ngirlish pleasure, as well she might; for the effect of the simple\\ndecoration was charming. Quite satisfied now, she tied on her cloud\\nand slipped away without waking Laura, little dreaming what good\\nfortune the ivy spray was to bring them both.\\n\\nShe found the children prancing with impatience to begin their\\nballet, much excited by the music, gaslight, and gay dresses, which\\nmade it seem like “a truly ball.” All welcomed Jessie, and she soon\\nforgot the cheap slippers, mended gloves, and old dress, as she\\ngayly led her troop through the pretty dance with so much grace and\\nskill that the admiring mammas who lined the walls declared it was\\nthe sweetest thing they ever saw.\\n\\n“Who is that little person?” asked one of the few gentlemen who\\nhovered about the doorways.\\n\\nHis hostess told Jessie’s story in a few words, and was surprised to\\nhear him say in a satisfied tone,--\\n\\n“I’m glad she is poor. I want her head, and now there is some chance\\nof getting it.”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Vane, what DO you mean?” asked the lady, laughing.\\n\\n“I came to study young faces; I want one for a picture, and that\\nlittle girl with the red leaves is charming. Please present me.”\\n\\n“No use; you may ask for her hand by-and-by, if you like, but not\\nfor her head. She is very proud, and never would consent to sit as a\\nmodel, I’m sure.”\\n\\n“I think I can manage it, if you will kindly give me a start.”\\n\\n“Very well. The children are just going down to supper, and Miss\\nDelano will rest. You can make your bold proposal now, if you dare.”\\n\\nA moment later, as she stood watching the little ones troop away,\\nJessie found herself bowing to the tall gentleman, who begged to\\nknow what he could bring her with as much interest as if she had\\nbeen the finest lady in the room. Of course she chose ice-cream, and\\nslipped into a corner to rest her tired feet, preferring the\\ndeserted parlor to the noisy dining-room,--not being quite sure\\nwhere she belonged now.\\n\\nMr. Vane brought her a salver full of the dainties girls best love,\\nand drawing up a table began to eat and talk in such a simple,\\ncomfortable way that Jessie could not feel shy, but was soon quite\\nat her ease. She knew that he was a famous artist, and longed to\\ntell him about poor Laura, who admired his pictures so much and\\nwould have enjoyed every moment of this chance interview. He was not\\na very young man, nor a handsome one, but he had a genial face, and\\nthe friendly manners which are so charming; and in ten minutes\\nJessie was chatting freely, quite unconscious that the artist was\\nstudying her in a mirror all the while. They naturally talked of the\\nchildren, and after praising the pretty dance Mr. Vane quietly\\nadded,--\\n\\n“I’ve been trying--to find a face among them for a picture I’m\\ndoing; but the little dears are all too young, and I must look\\nelsewhere for a model for my wood-nymph.”\\n\\n“Are models hard to find?” asked Jessie, eating her ice with the\\nrelish of a girl who does not often taste it.\\n\\n“What I want is very hard to find. I can get plenty of beggar-girls,\\nbut this must be a refined face, young and blooming, but with poetry\\nin it; and that does not come without a different training from any\\nmy usual models get. It will be difficult to suit me, for I’m in a\\nhurry and don’t know where to look,”--which last sentence was not\\nquite true, for the long glass showed him exactly what he wanted.\\n\\n“I help Mademoiselle with her classes, and she has pupils of all\\nages; perhaps you could find some one there.”\\n\\nJessie looked so interested that the artist felt that he had begun\\nwell, and ventured a step further as he passed the cake-basket for\\nthe third time.\\n\\n“You are very kind; but the trouble there is, that I fear none of\\nthe young ladies would consent to sit to me if I dared to ask them.\\nI will confide to you that I HAVE seen a head which quite suits me;\\nbut I fear I cannot get it. Give me your advice, please. Should you\\nthink this pretty creature would be offended, if I made the request\\nmost respectfully?”\\n\\n“No, indeed; I should think she would be proud to help with one of\\nyour pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; and we\\nkept one of them when we had to sell all the rest,” said Jessie, in\\nher eager, frank way.\\n\\n“That was a beautiful compliment, and I am proud of it. Please tell\\nher so, with my thanks. Which was it?”\\n\\n“The woman’s head,--the sad, sweet one people call a Madonna. We\\ncall it Mother, and love it very much, for Laura says it is like our\\nmother. I never saw her, but my sister remembers the dear face very\\nwell.”\\n\\nJessie’s eyes dropped, as if tears were near; and Mr. Vane said, in\\na voice which showed he understood and shared her feeling,--\\n\\n“I am very glad that anything of mine has been a comfort to you. I\\nthought of my own mother when I painted that picture years ago; so\\nyou see you read it truly, and gave it the right name. Now, about\\nthe other head; you think I may venture to propose the idea to its\\nowner, do you?”\\n\\n“Why not, sir? She would be very silly to refuse, I think.”\\n\\n“Then YOU wouldn’t be offended if asked to sit in this way?”\\n\\n“Oh, no. I’ve sat for Laura many a time, and she says I make a very\\ngood model. But then, she only paints simple little things that I am\\nfit for.”\\n\\n“That is just what I want to do. Would you mind asking the young\\nlady for me? She is just behind you.”\\n\\nJessie turned with a start, wondering who had come in; but all she\\nsaw was her own curious face in the mirror, and Mr. Vane’s smiling\\none above it.\\n\\n“Do you mean me?” she cried, so surprised and pleased and half\\nashamed that she could only blush and laugh and look prettier than\\never.\\n\\n“Indeed I do. Mrs. Murray thought the request would annoy you; but I\\nfancied you would grant it, you wore such a graceful little garland,\\nand seemed so interested in the pictures here.”\\n\\n“It is only a bit of ivy, but so pretty I wanted to wear it, as I\\nhad nothing else,” said the girl, glad that her simple ornament\\nfound favor in such eyes.\\n\\n“It is most artistic, and caught my eye at once. I said to myself,’\\nThat is the head I want, and I MUST secure it if possible.’ Can I?”\\n asked Mr. Vane, smiling persuasively as he saw what a frank and\\nartless young person he had to deal with.\\n\\n“With pleasure, if Laura doesn’t mind. I’ll ask her, and if she is\\nwilling I shall be very proud to have even my wreath in a famous\\npicture,” answered Jessie, so full of innocent delight at being thus\\nhonored that it was a pretty sight to see.\\n\\n“A thousand thanks! Now I can exult over Mrs. Murray, and get my\\npalette ready. When can we begin? As your sister is an invalid and\\ncannot come to my studio with you, perhaps you will allow me to make\\nmy sketch at your own house,” said Mr. Vane, as pleased with his\\nsuccess as only a perplexed artist could be.\\n\\n“Did Mrs. Murray tell you about us?” asked Jessie quickly, as her\\nsmiles faded away and the proud look came into her face; for she was\\nsure their misfortunes were known, since he spoke of poor Laura’s\\nhealth.\\n\\n“A little,” began the new friend, with a sympathetic glance.\\n\\n“I know models are paid for sitting; did you wish to do it with me\\nbecause I’m poor?” asked Jessie, with an irrepressible frown and a\\nglance at the thrice-cleaned dress and the neatly mended gloves.\\n\\nMr. Vane knew what thorn pricked the sensitive little girl, and\\nanswered in his friendliest tone,--\\n\\n“I never thought of such a thing. I wanted YOU to help ME, because I\\nam poor in what artists so much need,--real grace and beauty. I\\nhoped you would allow me to give your sister a copy of the sketch as\\na token of my gratitude for your great kindness.”\\n\\nThe frown vanished and the smile returned as the soft answer turned\\naway Jessie’s wrath and made her hasten to say penitently,--\\n\\n“I was very rude; but I haven’t learned to be humble yet, and often\\nforget that I am poor. Please come to us any time. Laura will enjoy\\nseeing you work, and be delighted with anything you give her. So\\nshall I, though I don’t deserve it.”\\n\\n“I won’t punish you by painting the frown that quite frightened me\\njust now, but do my best to keep the happy face, and so heap coals\\nof fire on your head. They won’t burn any more than the pretty red\\nleaves that brought me this good fortune,” answered the artist,\\nseeing that his peace was made.\\n\\n“I’m SO glad I wore them!” and as if trying to make amends for her\\nlittle flash of temper, Jessie told him about the ivy, and how she\\nloved it,--unconsciously betraying more of her pathetic little story\\nthan she knew, and increasing her hearer’s interest in his new\\nmodel.\\n\\nThe children came back in riotous spirits, and Jessie was called to\\nlead the revels again. But now her heart was as light as her heels;\\nfor she had something pleasant to think of,--a hope of help for\\nLaura, and the memory of kind words to make hard duties easier. Mr.\\nVane soon slipped away, promising to come the next day; and at eight\\no’clock Jessie ran home to tell her sister the good news, and to\\npress the little wreath which had served her so well.\\n\\nWith the sanguine spirit of girlhood, she felt sure that something\\ndelightful would happen, and built fine castles in the air for her\\nsister, with a small corner for herself, where she could watch Laura\\nbloom into a healthy woman and a great artist. The desire of\\nJessie’s heart was to earn eneugh money to enable them to spend a\\nmonth or two at the seashore when summer came, as that was the\\nsurest cure for Laura’s weak nerves and muscles. She had cherished\\nthe wild idea of being a ballet-girl, as dancing was her delight;\\nbut every one frowned upon that plan, and her own refined nature\\ntold her that it was not the life for a young girl. Mr. Vane’s\\nrequest for her head suggested a splendid hope; and after getting\\nangry with him for hinting at her being a model, she suddenly\\ndecided to try it,--with the charming inconsistency of her sex. The\\nmore she thought of it, the better she liked the idea, and resolved\\nto ask her new friend all about it, fondly hoping that much money\\ncould be made in this way.\\n\\nShe said nothing to her sister, but while she sat patiently to Mr.\\nVane when he came next day, she asked many questions; and though\\nsomewhat discouraged by his replies, confided to him her hopes and\\nbegged his advice. Being a wise man as well as a good and kindly\\none, he saw at once that this life would not be safe for the pretty,\\nimpulsive, and tenderly reared girl, left so unprotected in a world\\nfull of trials and temptations. So he told her it would not do,\\nexcept so far as she would allow him to make several studies of her\\nhead in various characters and pay for them.\\n\\nShe consented, and though much disappointed found some consolation\\nin hoarding a part of the handsome sum so earned for the desire of\\nher heart.\\n\\nThe artist seemed in no haste to finish his work, and for some weeks\\ncame often to the sittings in that quiet room; for it grew more and\\nmore attractive to him, and while he painted the younger sister’s\\nchangeful face he studied the beautiful nature of the elder and\\nlearned to love it. But no one guessed that secret for a long time;\\nand Jessie was so busy racking her brain for a way to earn more\\nmoney that she was as blind and deaf to much that went on before her\\nas if she had been a wooden dummy.\\n\\nSuddenly, when she least expected it, help came, and in such a\\ndelightful way that she long remembered the little episode with\\ngirlish satisfaction. One day as she sat wearily waiting till the\\ndressing-room was cleared of maids and children after the\\ndancing-class was over, a former friend came sauntering up to her,\\nsaying In the tone which always nettled Jessie,--\\n\\n“You poor thing! aren’t you tired to death trying to teach these\\nstupid babies?”\\n\\n“No; I love to dance, and we had new figures to-day. See! isn’t this\\npretty?” and Jessie, who knew her own skill and loved to display it,\\ntwirled away as lightly as if her feet were not aching with two\\nhours of hard work.\\n\\n“Lovely! I do wish I ever could learn to keep time and not jerk and\\nbounce. Being plump is a dreadful trial,” sighed Fanny Fletcher, as\\nJessie came back beaming and breathless.\\n\\n“Perhaps I can teach you. I think of making this my profession since\\nI must do something. Mademoiselle earns heaps of money by it,” she\\nsaid, sitting down to rest, resolved not to be ashamed of her work\\nor to let Fanny pity her.\\n\\n“I wish you COULD teach me, for I know I shall disgrace myself at\\nthe Kirmess. You’ve heard about it, of course? So sorry you can’t\\ntake a part, for it’s going to be great fun and very splendid. I am\\nin the Hungarian dance, and it’s one of the hardest; but the dress\\nis lovely, and I would be in it. Mamma is the matron of it; so I had\\nmy way, though I know the girls don’t want me, and the boys make fun\\nof me. Just see if this isn’t the queerest step you ever beheld!”\\n\\nFanny started bravely across the wide smooth floor, with a stamp, a\\nslide, and a twirl which was certainly odd, but might have been\\nlively and graceful if she had not unfortunately been a very plump,\\nawkward girl, with no more elasticity than a feather-bed. Jessie\\nfound it impossible not to laugh when Fanny ended her display with a\\nsprawl upon the floor, and sat rubbing her elbows in an attitude of\\ndespair.\\n\\n“I know that dance! It is the tzardas, and I can show you how it\\nshould be done. Jump up and try it with me!” she said good-naturedly,\\nrunning to help her friend up, glad to have a partner of her own\\nsize for once.\\n\\nAway they went, but soon stopped; for Fanny could not keep step, and\\nJessie pulled and stamped and hummed in vain.\\n\\n“Do it alone; then I can see how it goes, and manage better next\\ntime,” panted the poor girl, dropping down upon the velvet seat\\nwhich ran round the hall.\\n\\nMademoiselle had come in and watched them for a moment. She saw at\\nonce what was needed, and as Mrs. Fletcher was one of her best\\npatrons, she was glad to oblige the oldest daughter; so she went to\\nthe piano and struck up the proper air just as Jessie, with one arm\\non her hip, the other on the shoulder of an invisible partner, went\\ndown the hall with a martial stamp, a quick slide, and a graceful\\nturn, in perfect time to the stirring music that made her nerves\\ntingle and her feet fly. To and fro, round and round, with all\\nmanner of graceful gestures, intricate steps, and active bounds went\\nthe happy girl, quite carried away by the music and motion of the\\npastime she loved so much.\\n\\nFanny clapped her hands with admiration, and Mademoiselle cried,\\n“Bien, tres bien, charmante, ma cherie!” as she paused at last, rosy\\nand smiling, with one hand on her heart and the other at her temple\\nwith the salute that closed the dance.\\n\\n“I MUST learn it! Do come and give me lessons at our house. I called\\nfor Maud and must go now. Will you come, Jessie? I’ll be glad to pay\\nyou if you don’t mind. I hate to be laughed at; and I know if some\\none would just help me alone I should do as well as the rest, for\\nProfessor Ludwig raves at us all.”\\n\\nFanny seemed in such a sad strait, and Jessie sympathized so\\nheartily with her, that she could not refuse a request which\\nflattered her vanity and tempted her with a prospect of some\\naddition to the “Sister-fund,” as she called her little savings. So\\nshe graciously consented, and after a few laborious lessons\\nprospered so well that her grateful pupil proposed to several other\\nunsuccessful dancers in the set to invite Jessie to the private\\nrehearsals held in various parlors as the festival drew near.\\n\\nSome of these young people knew Jessie Delano, had missed the bright\\ngirl, and gladly welcomed her back when, after much persuasion, she\\nagreed to go and help them with the difficult figures of the\\ntzardas. Once among them she felt in her element, and trained the\\nawkward squad so well that Professor Ludwig complimented them on\\ntheir improvement at the public rehearsals, and raved no more, to\\nthe great delight of the timid damsels, who lost their wits when the\\nfiery little man shouted and wrung his hands over their mistakes.\\n\\nThe young gentlemen needed help also, as several of them looked very\\nmuch like galvanized grasshoppers in their efforts to manage long\\nlegs or awkward elbows. Jessie willingly danced with them, and\\nshowed them how to move with grace and spirit, and handle their\\npartners less like dolls and more like peasant maidens with whom the\\nmartial Hungarians were supposed to be disporting themselves at the\\nfair. Merry meetings were these; and all enjoyed them, as young\\npeople do whatever is lively, dramatic, and social. Every one was\\nfull of the brilliant Kirmess, which was the talk of the city, and\\nto which every one intended to go as actor or spectator. Jessie was\\nsadly tempted to spend three of her cherished dollars for a ticket,\\nand perhaps would have done so if there had been any one to take\\ncare of her. Laura could not go, and Mr. Vane was away; no other\\nfriend appeared, and no one remembered to invite her, so she bravely\\nhid her girlish longing, and got all the pleasure out of the\\nrehearsals that she could.\\n\\nAt the last of these, which was a full-dress affair at Fanny’s\\nhouse, something happened which not only tried Jessie’s temper\\nsorely, but brought her a reward for many small sacrifices. So much\\ndancing was very hard upon her slippers, the new pair were worn out\\nlong ago, and a second pair were in a dangerous condition; but\\nJessie hoped that they would last that evening, and then she would\\nindulge in better ones with what Fanny would pay her. She hated to\\ntake it, but her salary at Mademoiselle’s was needed at home; all\\nshe could spare from other sources was sacredly kept for Laura’s\\njaunt, and only now and then did the good little girl buy some very\\nnecessary article for herself. She was learning to be humble, to\\nlove work, and be grateful for her small wages for her sister’s\\nsake; and while she hid her trials, withstood her temptations, and\\nbravely tugged away at her hard tasks, the kind Providence, who\\nteaches us the sweetness of adversity, was preparing a more\\nbeautiful and helpful surprise than any she could plan or execute.\\n\\nThat night all were much excited, and great was the energy displayed\\nas the scarlet, blue, and silver couples went through the rapid\\nfigures with unusual spirit and success. The brass-heeled boots\\nstamped in perfect time, the furred caps waved, and the braided\\njackets glittered as the gay troop swung to and fro or marched to\\nthe barbaric music of an impromptu band. Jessie looked on with such\\nlonging in her eyes that Fanny, who was ill with a bad cold, kindly\\nbegged her to take her place, as motion made her cough, and putting\\non the red and silver cap sent her joyfully away to lead them all.\\n\\nThe fun grew rather fast and furious toward the end, and when the\\ndance broke up there lay in the middle of the floor a shabby little\\nslipper, burst at the side, trodden down at the heel, and utterly\\ndemoralized as to the bow with a broken buckle in it. Such a\\ndisreputable little shoe was it that no one claimed it when one of\\nthe young men held it up on the point of his sword, exclaiming\\ngayly,--\\n\\n“Where is Cinderella? Here’s her shoe, and it’s quite time she had a\\nnew pair. Glass evidently doesn’t wear well now-a-days.”\\n\\nThey all laughed and looked about to find the shoeless foot. The\\ngirls with small feet displayed them readily; those less blessed hid\\nthem at once, and no Cinderella appeared to claim the old slipper.\\nJessie turned as red as her cap, and glanced imploringly at Fanny as\\nshe slipped through a convenient door and flew up-stairs, knowing\\nthat in a moment all would see that it must be hers, since the other\\ngirls wore red boots as a part of their costume.\\n\\nFanny understood; and though awkward and slow with her feet, she was\\nkind-hearted and quick to spare her friend the mortification which a\\npoor and proud girl could not help feeling at such a moment. The\\nunfortunate slipper was flying from hand to hand as the youths\\nindulged in a boyish game of ball to tease the laughing girls, who\\nhastened to disclaim all knowledge of “the horrid thing.”\\n\\n“Please give it to me!” cried Fanny, trying to catch it, and glad\\nJessie was safe.\\n\\n“No; Cinderella must come and put it on. Here’s the Prince all ready\\nto help her,” said the finder of the shoe, holding it up.\\n\\n“And here are lots of proud sisters ready to cut off their toes and\\nheels if they could only get on such a small slipper,” added another\\nyoung Mygar, enjoying the fun immensely.\\n\\n“Listen, and let me tell you something. It’s Jessie Delano’s, and\\nshe has run away because she lost it. Don’t laugh and make fun of\\nit, because it was worn out in helping us. You all know what a hard\\ntime she has had, but you don’t know how good and brave and patient\\nshe is, trying to help poor Laura and to earn her living. I asked\\nher to teach me, and I shall pay her well for it, because I couldn’t\\nhave gone on if she hadn’t. If any of you feel as grateful as I do,\\nand as sorry for her, you can show it in any kind way you please,\\nfor it must be dreadful to be so poor.”\\n\\nFanny had spoken quickly, and at the last words hid the tremble in\\nher voice with a cough, being rather scared at what she had done on\\nthe impulse of the moment. But it was a true impulse, and the\\ngenerous young hearts were quick to answer it. The old slipper was\\nrespectfully handed to her with many apologies and various penitent\\nsuggestions. None were adopted just then, however, for Fanny ran off\\nto find Jessie with her things on waiting for a chance to slip away\\nunseen. No persuasions would keep her to supper; and at last, with\\nmany thanks, she was allowed to go, while Fanny returned to lay\\nplans with her guests as they disturbed their digestions with\\nlobster salad, ice-cream, and strong coffee.\\n\\nFeeling more than ever like Cinderella as she hurried out into the\\nwinter night, leaving all the good times behind her, Jessie stood\\nwaiting for a car on the windy street-corner, with the ragged\\nslippers under her arm, tears of weariness and vexation in her eyes,\\nand a resentful feeling against an unjust fate lying heavy at her\\nheart. The glimpses of her old gay, easy life, which these\\nrehearsals had given her, made the real hardship and loneliness of\\nher present life all the more irksome, and that night she felt as if\\nshe could not bear it much longer. She longed with all a girl’s love\\nof gayety to go to the Kirmess, and no one thought to invite her.\\nShe could not go alone even if she yielded to temptation and spent\\nher own money. Laura would have to hire a carriage if she ventured\\nto try it; so it was impossible, for six or seven dollars was a\\nfortune to the poor girls now. To have been one of the happy\\ncreatures who were to take part in it, to dance on the green in a\\ndainty costume to the music of a full band,--to see and do and enjoy\\nall the delights of those two enchanting evenings, would have filled\\nJessie’s cup to overflowing. But since she might as well cry for the\\nmoon she tried to get some comfort out of imagining it all as she\\nrumbled home in a snowstorm, and cried herself to sleep after giving\\nLaura a cheerful account of the rehearsal, omitting the catastrophe.\\n\\nThe sun shone next morning, hope woke again, and as she dressed\\nJessie sung to keep her heart up, still trusting that some one would\\nremember her before the day was over. As she opened her windows the\\nsparrows welcomed her with shrill chirpings, and the sun turned the\\nsnow-covered vine to a glittering network very beautiful to see as\\nit hung like a veil of lace over the dingy wall. Jessie smiled as\\nshe saw it, while taking a long breath of the keen air, feeling\\ncheered and refreshed by these familiar comforters; then with a\\nbrave, bright glance up at the clear blue sky she went away to the\\nday’s duties, little guessing what pleasant surprises were on their\\nway to reward her for the little sacrifices which were teaching her\\nstrength, patience, and courage for greater ones by-and-by.\\n\\nAll the morning she listened eagerly for the bell, but nothing came;\\nand at two o’clock she went away to the dancing-class, saying to\\nherself with a sigh,--\\n\\n“Every one is so busy, it is no wonder I’m forgotten. I shall hear\\nabout the fun in the papers, and try to be contented with that.”\\n\\nThough she never felt less like dancing, she was very patient with\\nher little pupils, and when the lesson was over sat resting a\\nmoment, with her head still full of the glories of the Kirmess.\\nSuddenly Mademoiselle came to her, and in a few kind words gave her\\nthe first of the pleasant surprises by offering her a larger salary,\\nan older class, and many commendations for her skill and\\nfaithfulness. Of course she gratefully accepted the welcome offer,\\nand hurried home to tell Laura, forgetting her heavy heart, tired\\nfeet, and disappointed hopes.\\n\\nAt her own door the second surprise stood waiting for her, in the\\nperson of Mrs. Fletcher’s servant with a large box and a note from\\nMiss Fanny. How she ever got herself and her parcel up the long\\nstairs Jessie never knew, she was in such a frantic hurry to see\\nwhat that vast box could contain. She startled her sister by\\nbursting into the room breathless, flushed, and beaming, with the\\nmysterious cry of,--\\n\\n“Scissors! quick, the scissors!”\\n\\nOff went cords and papers, up flew the cover, and with a shriek of\\nrapture Jessie saw the well-known Hungarian costume lying there\\nbefore her. What it all meant she could not guess, till she tore\\nopen the note and read these delightful words:--\\n\\nDEAR JESS,--My cold is worse, and the doctor won’t let me go\\nto-night. Isn’t it dreadful? Our dance will be ruined unless you\\nwill take my place. I know you will to oblige us, and have a lovely\\ntime. Every one will be glad, you do it so much better than I can.\\nMy dress will fit you, with tucks and reefs here and there; and the\\nboots won’t be much too large, for though I’m fat I have small feet,\\nthank goodness! Mamma will call for you at seven, and bring you\\nsafely home; and you must come early to-morrow and tell me all about\\nit.\\n\\nIn the small box you will find a little token of our gratitude to\\nyou for your kindness in helping us all so much. Yours ever,\\n\\nFAN.\\n\\nAs soon as Jessie could get her breath and recover from this first\\ndelightful shock, she opened the dainty parcel carefully tied up\\nwith pink ribbons. It proved to be a crystal slipper, apparently\\nfull of rosebuds; but under the flowers lay five-and-twenty shining\\ngold dollars. A little card with these words was tucked in one\\ncorner, as if, with all their devices to make the offering as\\ndelicate and pretty as possible, the givers feared to offend:--\\n\\n“We return to our dear Princess the glass slipper which she lost at\\nthe ball, full of thanks and good wishes.”\\n\\nIf the kind young persons who sent the fanciful gift could have seen\\nhow it was received, their doubts would soon have been set at rest;\\nfor Jessie laughed and cried as she told the story, counted the\\nprecious coins, and filled the pretty shoe with water that the buds\\nmight keep fresh for Laura. Then, while the needles flew and the gay\\ngarments were fitted, the happy voices talked and the sisters\\nrejoiced together over this unexpected pleasure as only loving girls\\ncould do.\\n\\n“The sweetest part of all the splendid surprise is that they\\nremembered me just at the busiest time, and thanked me in such a\\nlovely way. I shall keep that glass slipper all my life, if I can,\\nto remind me not to despair; for just when everything seemed\\ndarkest, all this good luck came,” said Jessie, with ecstatic skips\\nas she clanked the brass heels of her boots and thought of the proud\\nmoment when she would join in the tzardas before all Boston.\\n\\nGentle Laura rejoiced and sympathized heartily, sewed like a busy\\nbee, and sent her happy sister away at seven o’clock with her\\nsweetest smile, never letting her suspect what tender hopes and\\nfears were hidden in her own heart, what longing and disappointment\\nmade her days doubly sad and lonely, or how very poor a consolation\\nall the glories of the Kirmess would be for the loss of a friend who\\nhad grown very near and dear to her.\\n\\nNo need to tell the raptures of that evening to little Jessie, who\\nenjoyed every moment, played her part well, and was brought home at\\nmidnight ready to begin all over again, so inexhaustible is youth’s\\nappetite for pleasure.\\n\\nTo her great surprise, Laura was up and waiting to welcome her, with\\na face so full of a new and lovely happiness that Jessie guessed at\\nonce some good fortune had come to her also. Yes, Laura’s\\nwell-earned reward and beautiful surprise had arrived at last; and\\nshe told it all in a few words as she held out her arms\\nexclaiming,--\\n\\n“He has come back! He loves me, and I am so happy! Dear little\\nsister, all your hard times are over now, and you shall have a home\\nagain.”\\n\\nSo the dreams came true, as they sometimes do even in this\\nwork-a-day world of ours, when the dreamers strive as well as hope,\\nand earn their rewards.\\n\\nLaura had a restful summer at the seaside, with a stronger arm than\\nJessie’s to lean upon, and more magical medicine to help her back to\\nhealth than any mortal doctor could prescribe. Jessie danced again\\nwith a light heart,--for pleasure, not for pay,--and found the new\\nlife all the sweeter for the trials of the old one. In the autumn\\nthere was a quiet wedding, before three very happy people sailed\\naway to Italy, the artist’s heaven on earth.\\n\\n“No roses for me,” said Jessie, smiling at herself in the mirror as\\nshe fastened a spray of rosy ivy-leaves in the bosom of her fresh\\nwhite gown that October morning. “I’ll be true to my old friend; for\\nit helped me in my dark days, and now it shall rejoice with me in my\\nbright ones, and go on teaching me to climb bravely and patiently\\ntoward the light.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPANSIES\\n\\n\\nThey are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts.--SIR\\nPHILIP SIDNEY.\\n\\n“I’VE finished my book, and now what CAN I do till this tiresome\\nrain is over?” exclaimed Carrie, as she lay back on the couch with a\\nyawn of weariness.\\n\\n“Take another and a better book; the house is full of them, and this\\nis a rare chance for a feast on the best,” answered Alice, looking\\nover the pile of volumes in her lap, as she sat on the floor before\\none of the tall book-cases that lined the room.\\n\\n“Not being a book-worm like you, I can’t read forever, and you\\nneedn’t sniff at ‘Wanda,’ for it’s perfectly thrilling!” cried\\nCarrie, regretfully turning the crumpled leaves of the Seaside\\nLibrary copy of that interminable and impossible tale.\\n\\n“We should read to improve our minds, and that rubbish is only a\\nwaste of time,” began Alice, in a warning tone, as she looked up\\nfrom “Romola,” over which she had been poring with the delight one\\nfeels in meeting an old friend.\\n\\n“I don’t WISH to improve my mind, thank you: I read for amusement in\\nvacation time, and don’t want to see any moral works till next\\nautumn. I get enough of them in school. This isn’t ‘rubbish’! It’s\\nfull of fine descriptions of scenery--”\\n\\n“Which you skip by the page, I’ve seen you do it,” said Eva, the\\nthird young girl in the library, as she shut up the stout book on\\nher knee and began to knit as if this sudden outburst of chat\\ndisturbed her enjoyment of “The Dove in the Eagle’s Nest.”\\n\\n“I do at first, being carried away by my interest in the people, but\\nI almost always go back and read them afterward,” protested Carrie.\\n“You know YOU like to hear about nice clothes, Eva, and Wanda’s were\\nsimply gorgeous; white velvet and a rope of pearls is one costume;\\ngray velvet and a silver girdle another; and Idalia was all a\\n‘shower of perfumed laces,’ and scarlet and gold satin mask dresses,\\nor primrose silk with violets, so lovely! I do revel in ‘em!”\\n\\nBoth girls laughed as Carrie reeled off this list of elegances, with\\nthe relish of a French modiste.\\n\\n“Well, I’m poor and can’t have as many pretty things as I want, so\\nit IS delightful to read about women who wear white quilted satin\\ndressing-gowns and olive velvet trains with Mechlin lace sweepers to\\nthem. Diamonds as large as nuts, and rivers of opals and sapphires,\\nand rubies and pearls, are great fun to read of, if you never even\\nget a look at real ones. I don’t believe the love part does me a bit\\nof harm, for we never see such languid swells in America, nor such\\nlovely, naughty ladies; and Ouida scolds them all, so of course she\\ndoesn’t approve of them, and that’s moral, I’m sure.”\\n\\nBut Alice shook her head again, as Carrie paused out of breath, and\\nsaid in her serious way: “That’s the harm of it all. False and\\nfoolish things are made interesting, and we read for that, not for\\nany lesson there may be hidden under the velvet and jewels and fine\\nwords of your splendid men and women. Now, THIS book is a wonderful\\npicture of Florence in old times, and the famous people who really\\nlived are painted in it, and it has a true and clean moral that we\\ncan all see, and one feels wiser and better for reading it. I do\\nwish you’d leave those trashy things and try something really good.”\\n\\n“I hate George Eliot,--so awfully wise and preachy and dismal! I\\nreally couldn’t wade through ‘Daniel Deronda,’ though ‘The Mill on\\nthe Floss’ wasn’t bad,” answered Carrie, with another yawn, as she\\nrecalled the Jew Mordecai’s long speeches, and Daniel’s meditations.\\n\\n“I know you’d like this,” said Eva, patting her book with an air of\\ncalm content; for she was a modest, common-sense little body, full\\nof innocent fancies and the mildest sort of romance. “I love dear\\nMiss Yonge, with her nice, large families, and their trials, and\\ntheir pious ways, and pleasant homes full of brothers and sisters,\\nand good fathers and mothers. I’m never tired of them, and have read\\n‘Daisy Chain’ nine times at least.”\\n\\n“I used to like them, and still think them good for young girls,\\nwith our own ‘Queechy’ and ‘Wide, Wide World,’ and books of that\\nkind. Now I’m eighteen I prefer stronger novels, and books by great\\nmen and women, because these are always talked about by cultivated\\npeople, and when I go into society next winter I wish to be able to\\nlisten intelligently, and know what to admire.”\\n\\n“That’s all very well for you, Alice; you were always poking over\\nbooks, and I dare say you will write them some day, or be a\\nblue-stocking. But I’ve got another year to study and fuss over my\\neducation, and I’m going to enjoy myself all I can, and leave the\\nwise books till I come out.”\\n\\n“But, Carrie, there won’t be any time to read them; you’ll be so\\nbusy with parties, and beaux, and travelling, and such things. I\\nWOULD take Alice’s advice and read up a little now; it’s so nice to\\nknow useful things, and be able to find help and comfort in good\\nbooks when trouble comes, as Ellen Montgomery and Fleda did, and\\nEthel, and the other girls in Miss Yonge’s stories,” said Eva,\\nearnestly, remembering how much the efforts of those natural little\\nheroines had helped her in her own struggles tor self-control and\\nthe cheerful bearing of the burdens which come to all.\\n\\n“I don’t want to be a priggish Ellen, or a moral Fleda, and I do\\ndetest bothering about self-improvement all the time. I know I\\nought, but I’d rather wait another year or two, and enjoy my\\nvanities in peace just a LITTLE longer.” And Carrie tucked Wanda\\nunder the sofa pillow, as if a trifle ashamed of her society, with\\nEva’s innocent eyes upon her own, and Alice sadly regarding her over\\nthe rampart of wise books, which kept growing higher as the eager\\ngirl found more and more treasures in this richly stored library.\\n\\nA little silence followed, broken only by the patter of the rain\\nwithout, the crackle of the wood fire within, and the scratch of a\\nbusy pen from a curtained recess at the end of the long room. In the\\nsudden hush the girls heard it and remembered that they were not\\nalone.\\n\\n“She must have heard every word we said!” and Carrie sat up with a\\ndismayed face as she spoke in a whisper.\\n\\nEva laughed, but Alice shrugged her shoulders, and said tranquilly,\\n“I don’t mind. She wouldn’t expect much wisdom from school-girls.”\\n\\nThis was cold comfort to Carrie, who was painfully conscious of\\nhaving been a particularly silly school-girl just then. So she gave\\na groan and lay down again, wishing she had not expressed her\\nviews quite so freely, and had kept Wanda for the privacy of her own\\nroom.\\n\\nThe three girls were the guests of a delightful old lady, who had\\nknown their mothers and was fond of renewing her acquaintance with\\nthem through their daughters. She loved young people, and each\\nsummer invited parties of them to enjoy the delights of her\\nbeautiful country house, where she lived alone now, being the\\nchildless widow of a somewhat celebrated man. She made it very\\npleasant for her guests, leaving them free to employ a part of the\\nday as they liked, providing the best of company at dinner, gay\\nrevels in the evening, and a large house full of curious and\\ninteresting things to examine at their leisure.\\n\\nThe rain had spoiled a pleasant plan, and business letters had made\\nit necessary for Mrs. Warburton to leave the three to their own\\ndevices after lunch. They had read quietly for several hours, and\\ntheir hostess was just finishing her last letter when fragments of\\nthe conversation reached her ear. She listened with amusement,\\nunconscious that they had forgotten her presence, finding the\\ndifferent views very characteristic, and easily explained by the\\ndifference of the homes out of which the three friends came.\\n\\nAlice was the only daughter of a scholarly man and a brilliant\\nwoman; therefore her love of books and desire to cultivate her mind\\nwas very natural, but the danger in her case would be in the neglect\\nof other things equally important, too varied reading, and a\\nsuperficial knowledge of many authors rather than a true\\nappreciation of a few of the best and greatest. Eva was one of many\\nchildren in a happy home, with a busy father, a pious mother, and\\nmany domestic cares, as well as joys, already falling to the dutiful\\ngirl’s lot. Her instincts were sweet and unspoiled, and she only\\nneeded to be shown where to find new and better helpers for the real\\ntrials of life, when the childish heroines she loved could no longer\\nserve her in the years to come.\\n\\nCarrie was one of the ambitious yet commonplace girls who wish to\\nshine, without knowing the difference between the glitter of a\\ncandle which attracts moths, and the serene light of a star, or the\\ncheery glow of a fire round which all love to gather. Her mother’s\\naims were not high, and the two pretty daughters knew that she\\ndesired good matches for them, educated them for that end, and\\nexpected them to do their parts when the time came. The elder sister\\nwas now at a watering-place with her mother, and Carrie hoped that a\\nletter would soon come telling her that Mary was settled. During her\\nstay with Mrs. Warburton she had learned a good deal, and was\\nunconsciously contrasting the life here with the frivolous one at\\nhome, made up of public show and private sacrifice of comfort,\\ndignity, and peace. Here were people who dressed simply, enjoyed\\nconversation, kept up their accomplishments even when old, and were\\nso busy, lovable, and charming, that poor Carrie often felt vulgar,\\nignorant, and mortified among them, in spite of their fine breeding\\nand kindliness. The society Mrs. Warburton drew about her was the\\nbest, and old and young, rich and poor, wise and simple, all seemed\\ngenuine,---glad to give or receive, enjoy and rest, and then go out\\nto their work refreshed by the influences of the place and the sweet\\nold lady who made it what it was. The girls would soon begin life\\nfor themselves, and it was well that they had this little glimpse of\\nreally good society before they left the shelter of home to choose\\nfriends, pleasures, and pursuits for themselves, as all young women\\ndo when once launched.\\n\\nThe sudden silence and then the whispers suggested to the listener\\nthat she had perhaps heard something not meant for her ears; so she\\npresently emerged with her letters, and said, as she came smiling\\ntoward the group about the fire,--\\n\\n“How are you getting through this long, dull afternoon, my dears?\\nQuiet as mice till just now. What woke you up? A battle of the\\nbooks? Alice looks as if she had laid in plenty of ammunition, and\\nyou were preparing to besiege her.”\\n\\nThe girls laughed, and all rose, for Madam Warburton was a stately\\nold lady, and people involuntarily treated her with great respect,\\neven in this mannerless age.\\n\\n“We were only talking about books,” began Carrie, deeply grateful\\nthat Wanda was safely out of sight.\\n\\n“And we couldn’t agree,” added Eva, running to ring the bell for the\\nman to take the letters, for she was used to these little offices at\\nhome, and loved to wait on Madam.\\n\\n“Thanks, my love. Now let us talk a little, if you are tired of\\nreading, and if you like to let me share the discussion. Comparing\\ntastes in literature is always a pleasure, and I used to enjoy\\ntalking over books with my girl friends more than anything else.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton sat down in the chair which Alice\\nrolled up, drew Eva to the cushion at her feet, and nodded to the\\nothers as they settled again, with interested faces, one at the\\ntable where the pile of chosen volumes now lay, the other erect upon\\nthe couch where she had been practising the poses “full of languid\\ngrace,” so much affected by her favorite heroines.\\n\\n“Carrie was laughing at me for liking wise books and wanting to\\nimprove my mind. Is it foolish and a waste of time?” asked Alice,\\neager to convince her friend and secure so powerful an ally.\\n\\n“No, my dear, it is a very sensible desire, and I wish more girls\\nhad it. Only don’t be greedy, and read too much; cramming and\\nsmattering is as bad as promiscuous novel-reading, or no reading at\\nall. Choose carefully, read intelligently, and digest thoroughly\\neach book, and then you make it your own,” answered Mrs. Warburton,\\nquite in her element now, for she loved to give advice, as most old\\nladies do.\\n\\n“But how can we know WHAT to read if we mayn’t follow our tastes?”\\n said Carrie, trying to be interested and “intelligent” in spite of\\nher fear that a “school-marmy” lecture was in store for her.\\n\\n“Ask advice, and so cultivate a true and refined taste. I always\\njudge people’s characters a good deal by the books they like, as\\nwell as by the company they keep; so one should be careful, for this\\nis a pretty good test. Another is, be sure that whatever will not\\nbear reading aloud is not fit to read to one’s self. Many young\\ngirls ignorantly or curiously take up books quite worthless, and\\nreally harmful, because under the fine writing and brilliant color\\nlurks immorality or the false sentiment which gives wrong ideas of\\nlife and things which should be sacred. They think, perhaps, that no\\none knows this taste of theirs; but they are mistaken, for it shows\\nitself in many ways, and betrays them. Attitudes, looks, careless\\nwords, and a morbid or foolishly romantic view of certain things,\\nshow plainly that the maidenly instincts are blunted, and harm done\\nthat perhaps can never be repaired.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton kept her eyes fixed upon the tall andirons as if\\ngravely reproving them, which was a great relief to Carrie, whose\\ncheeks glowed as she stirred uneasily and took up a screen as if to\\nguard them from the fire. But conscience pricked her sharply, and\\nmemory, like a traitor, recalled many a passage or scene in her\\nfavorite books which she could not have read aloud even to that old\\nlady, though she enjoyed them in private. Nothing very bad, but\\nfalse and foolish, poor food for a lively fancy and young mind to\\nfeed on, as the weariness or excitement which always followed\\nplainly proved, since one should feel refreshed, not cloyed, with an\\nintellectual feast.\\n\\nAlice, with both elbows on the table, listened with wide-awake eyes,\\nand Eva watched the raindrops trickle clown the pane with an intent\\nexpression, as if asking herself if she had ever done this naughty\\nthing.\\n\\n“Then there is another fault,” continued Mrs. Warburton, well\\nknowing that her first shot had hit its mark, and anxious to be\\njust. “Some book-loving lassies have a mania for trying to read\\neverything, and dip into works far beyond their powers, or try too\\nmany different kinds of self-improvement at once. So they get a\\nmuddle of useless things into their heads, instead of well-assorted\\nideas and real knowledge. They must learn to wait and select; for\\neach age has its proper class of books, and what is Greek to us at\\neighteen may be just what we need at thirty. One can get mental\\ndyspepsia on meat and wine as well as on ice-cream and frosted cake,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice smiled, and pushed away four of the eight books she had\\nselected, as if afraid she had been greedy, and now felt that it was\\nbest to wait a little.\\n\\nEva looked up with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, “Now\\nit is my turn. Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to\\nRuskin, Kant, or Plato?”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton laughed, as she stroked the pretty brown head at her\\nknee.\\n\\n“Not yet, my love, perhaps never, for those are not the masters you\\nneed, I fancy. Since you like stories about every-day people, try\\nsome of the fine biographies of real men and women about whom you\\nshould know something. You will find their lives full of stirring,\\nhelpful, and lovely experiences, and in reading of these you will\\nget courage and hope and faith to bear your own trials as they come.\\nTrue stories suit you, and are the best, for there we get real\\ntragedy and comedy, and the lessons all must learn.”\\n\\n“Thank you! I will begin at once if you will kindly give me a list\\nof such as would be good for me,” cried Eva, with the sweet docility\\nof one eager to be all that is lovable and wise in woman.\\n\\n“Give us a list, and we will try to improve in the best way. You\\nknow what we need, and love to help foolish girls, or you wouldn’t\\nbe so kind and patient with us,” said Alice, going to sit beside\\nCarrie, hoping for much discussion of this, to her, very interesting\\nsubject.\\n\\n“I will, with pleasure; but I read few modern novels, so I may not\\nbe a good judge there. Most of them seem very poor stuff, and I\\ncannot waste time even to skim them as some people do. I still like\\nthe old-fashioned ones I read as a girl, though you would laugh at\\nthem. Did any of you ever read ‘Thaddeus of Warsaw’?”\\n\\n“I have, and thought it very funny; so were ‘Evelina’ and ‘Cecilia.’\\nI wanted to try Smollett and Fielding, after reading some fine\\nessays about them, but Papa told me I must wait,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Ah, my dears, in my day, Thaddeus was our hero, and we thought the\\nscene where he and Miss Beaufort are in the Park a most thrilling\\none. Two fops ask Thaddeus where he got his boots, and he replies,\\nwith withering dignity, ‘Where I got my sword, gentlemen.’ I\\ntreasured the picture of that episode for a long time. Thaddeus\\nwears a hat as full of black plumes as a hearse, Hessian boots with\\ntassels, and leans over Mary, who languishes on the seat in a\\nshort-waisted gown, limp scarf, poke bonnet, and large bag,--the height\\nof elegance then, but very funny now. Then William Wallace in ‘Scottish\\nChiefs.’ Bless me! we cried over him as much as you do over your ‘Heir\\nof Clifton,’ or whatever the boy’s name is. You wouldn’t get through it,\\nI fancy; and as for poor, dear, prosy Richardson, his letter-writing\\nheroines would bore you to death. Just imagine a lover saying to a\\nfriend, ‘I begged my angel to stay and sip one dish of tea. She sipped\\none dish and flew.’”\\n\\n“Now, I’m sure that’s sillier than anything the Duchess ever wrote\\nwith her five-o’clock teas and flirtations over plum-cake on lawns,”\\n cried Carrie, as they all laughed at the immortal Lovelace.\\n\\n“I never read Richardson, but he couldn’t be duller than Henry\\nJames, with his everlasting stories, full of people who talk a great\\ndeal and amount to nothing. _I_ like the older novels best, and\\nenjoy some of Scott’s and Miss Edgeworth’s better than Howells’s, or\\nany of the modern realistic writers, with their elevators, and\\npaint-pots, and every-day people,” said Alice, who wasted little\\ntime on light literature.\\n\\n“I’m glad to hear you say so, for I have an old-fashioned fancy that\\nI’d rather read about people as they were, for that is history, or\\nas they might and should be, for that helps us in our own efforts;\\nnot as they are, for that we know, and are all sufficiently\\ncommonplace ourselves, to be the better for a nobler and wider view\\nof life and men than any we are apt to get, so busy are we earning\\ndaily bread, or running after fortune, honor or some other bubble.\\nBut I mustn’t lecture, or I shall bore you, and forget that I am\\nyour hostess, whose duty it is to amuse.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton paused, Carrie, anxious to change the subject,\\nsaid, with her eyes on a curious jewel which the old lady wore, “I\\nalso like true stories, and you promised to tell us about that\\nlovely pin some day. This is just the time for it,--please do.”\\n\\n“With pleasure, for the little romance is quite apropos to our\\npresent chat. It is a very simple tale, and rather sad, but it had a\\ngreat influence on my life, and this brooch is very dear to me.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton sat silent a moment, the girls all looked with\\ninterest at the quaint pin which clasped the soft folds of muslin\\nover the black silk dress which was as becoming to the still\\nhandsome woman as the cap on her white hair and the winter roses in\\nher cheeks. The ornament was in the shape of a pansy; its purple\\nleaves were of amethyst, the yellow of topaz, and in the middle lay\\na diamond drop of dew. Several letters were delicately cut on its\\ngolden stem, and a guard pin showed how much its wearer valued it.\\n\\n“My sister Lucretia was a good deal older than I, for the three boys\\ncame between,” began Mrs. Warburton, still gazing at the fire, as if\\nfrom its ashes the past rose up bright and warm again. “She was a\\nvery lovely and superior girl, and I looked up to her with wonder as\\nwell as adoration. Others did the same, and at eighteen she was\\nengaged to a charming man, who would have made his mark had he\\nlived. She was too young to marry then, and Frank Lyman had a fine\\nopening to practise his profession at the South. So they parted for\\ntwo years, and it was then that he gave her the brooch, saying to\\nher, as she whispered how lonely she should be without him, ‘This\\nPENSEE is a happy, faithful THOUGHT of me. Wear it, dearest girl,\\nand don’t pine while we are separated. Read and study, write much to\\nme, and remember, “They never are alone that are accompanied with\\nnoble thoughts.”’”\\n\\n“Wasn’t that sweet?” cried Eva, pleased with the beginning of the\\ntale.\\n\\n“So romantic!” added Carrie, recalling the “amber amulet” one of her\\npet heroes wore for years, and died kissing, after he had killed\\nsome fifty Arabs in the desert.\\n\\n“Did she read and study?” asked Alice, with a soft color in her\\ncheek, and eager eyes, for a budding romance was folded away in the\\ndepths of her maidenly heart, and she liked a love story.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what she did, for it was rather remarkable at that\\nday, when girls had little schooling, and picked up accomplishments\\nas they could. The first winter she read and studied at home, and\\nwrote much to Mr. Lyman. I have their letters now, and very fine\\nones they are, though they would seem old-fashioned to you young\\nthings. Curious love letters,--full of advice, the discussion of\\nbooks, report of progress, glad praise, modest gratitude, happy\\nplans and a faithful affection that never wavered, though Lucretia\\nwas beautiful and much admired, and the dear fellow a great favorite\\namong the brilliant Southern women.\\n\\n“The second spring, Lucretia, anxious to waste no time, and\\nambitious to surprise Lyman, decided to go and study with old Dr.\\nGardener at Portland. He fitted young men for college, was a friend\\nof our father’s, and had a daughter who was a very wise and\\naccomplished woman. That was a very happy summer, and Lu got on so\\nwell that she begged to stay all winter. It was a rare chance, for\\nthere were no colleges for girls then, and very few advantages to be\\nhad, and the dear creature burned to improve every faculty, that she\\nmight be more worthy of her lover. She fitted herself for college\\nwith the youths there, and did wonders; for love sharpened her wits,\\nand the thought of that happy meeting spurred her on to untiring\\nexertion. Lyman was expected in May, and the wedding was to be in\\nJune; but, alas for the poor girl! the yellow-fever came, and he was\\none of the first victims. They never met again, and nothing was left\\nher of all that happy time but his letters, his library, and the\\npansy.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton paused to wipe a few quiet tears from her eyes, while\\nthe girls sat in sympathetic silence.\\n\\n“We thought it would kill her, that sudden change from love, hope,\\nand happiness to sorrow, death, and solitude. But hearts don’t\\nbreak, my dears, if they know where to go for strength. Lucretia\\ndid, and after the first shock was over found comfort in her books,\\nsaying, with a brave, bright look, and the sweetest resignation, ‘I\\nmust go on trying to be more worthy of him, for we shall meet again\\nin God’s good time and he shall see that I do not forget.’\\n\\n“That was better than tears and lamentation, and the long years that\\nfollowed were beautiful and busy ones, full of dutiful care for us\\nat home after our mother died, of interest in all the good works of\\nher time, and a steady, quiet effort to improve every faculty of her\\nfine mind, till she was felt to be one of the noblest women in our\\ncity. Her influence was wide-spread; all the intelligent people\\nsought her, and when she travelled she was welcome everywhere, for\\ncultivated persons have a free-masonry of their own, and are\\nrecognized at once.”\\n\\n“Did she ever marry?” asked Carrie, feeling that no life could be\\nquite successful without that great event.\\n\\n“Never. She felt herself a widow, and wore black to the day of her\\ndeath. Many men asked her hand, but she refused them all, and was\\nthe sweetest ‘old maid’ ever seen,--cheerful and serene to the very\\nlast, for she was ill a long time, and found her solace and stay\\nstill in the beloved books. Even when she could no longer read them,\\nher memory supplied her with the mental food that kept her soul\\nstrong while her body failed. It was wonderful to see and hear her\\nrepeating fine lines, heroic sayings, and comforting psalms through\\nthe weary nights when no sleep would come, making friends and\\nhelpers of the poets, philosophers, and saints whom she knew and\\nloved so well. It made death beautiful, and taught me how victorious\\nan immortal soul can be over the ills that vex our mortal flesh.\\n\\n“She died at dawn on Easter Sunday, after a quiet night, when she\\nhad given me her little legacy of letters, books, and the one jewel\\nshe had always worn, repeating her lover’s words to comfort me. I\\nhad read the Commendatory Prayer, and as I finished she whispered,\\nwith a look of perfect peace, ‘Shut the book, dear, I need study no\\nmore; I have hoped and believed, now I shall know;’ and so went\\nhappily away to meet her lover after patient waiting.”\\n\\nThe sigh of the wind was the only sound that broke the silence till\\nthe quiet voice went on again, as if it loved to tell the story, for\\nthe thought of soon seeing the beloved sister took the sadness from\\nthe memory of the past.\\n\\n“I also found my solace in books, for I was very lonely when she was\\ngone, my father being dead, the brothers married, and home desolate.\\nI took to study and reading as a congenial employment, feeling no\\ninclination to marry, and for many years was quite contented among\\nmy books. But in trying to follow in dear Lucretia’s footsteps, I\\nunconsciously fitted myself for the great honor and happiness of my\\nlife, and curiously enough I owed it to a book.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton smiled as she took up a shabby little volume from the\\ntable where Alice had laid it, and, quick to divine another romance,\\nEva said, like a story-loving child, “Do tell about it! The other\\nwas so sad.”\\n\\n“This begins merrily, and has a wedding in it, as young girls think\\nall tales should. Well, when I was about thirty-five, I was invited\\nto join a party of friends on a trip to Canada, that being the\\nfavorite jaunt in my young days. I’d been studying hard for some\\nyears, and needed rest, so I was glad to go. As a good book for an\\nexcursion, I took this Wordsworth in my bag. It is full of fine\\npassages, you know, and I loved it, for it was one of the books\\ngiven to Lucretia by her lover. We had a charming time, and were on\\nour way to Quebec when my little adventure happened. I was in\\nraptures over the grand St. Lawrence as we steamed slowly from\\nMontreal that lovely summer day. I could not read, but sat on the\\nupper deck, feasting my eyes and dreaming dreams as even staid\\nmaiden ladies will when out on a holiday. Suddenly I caught the\\nsound of voices in earnest discussion on the lower deck, and,\\nglancing down, saw several gentlemen leaning against the rail as\\nthey talked over certain events of great public interest at that\\nmoment. I knew that a party of distinguished persons were on\\nboard, as my friend’s husband, Dr. Tracy, knew some of them, and\\npointed out Mr. Warburton as one of the rising scientific men of the\\nday. I remembered that my sister had met him years ago, and much\\nadmired him both for his own gifts and because he had known Lyman.\\nAs other people were listening, I felt no delicacy about doing the\\nsame, for the conversation was an eloquent one, and well worth\\ncatching. So interested did I become that I forgot the great rafts\\nfloating by, the picturesque shores, the splendid river, and leaned\\nnearer and nearer that no word might be lost, till my book slid out\\nof my lap and fell straight down upon the head of one of the\\ngentlemen, giving him a smart blow, and knocking his hat overboard.”\\n\\n“Oh, what DID you do?” cried the girls, much amused at this\\nunromantic catastrophe.\\n\\nMrs. Warburton clasped her hands dramatically, as her eyes twinkled\\nand a pretty color came into her cheeks at the memory of that\\nexciting moment.\\n\\n“My dears, I could have dropped with mortification! What COULD I do\\nbut dodge and peep as I waited to see the end of this most untoward\\naccident? Fortunately I was alone on that side of the deck, so none\\nof the ladies saw my mishap and, slipping along the seat to a\\ndistant corner, I hid my face behind a convenient newspaper, as I\\nwatched the little flurry of fishing up the hat by a man in a boat\\nnear by, and the merriment of the gentlemen over this assault of\\nWilliam Wordsworth upon Samuel Warburton. The poor book passed from\\nhand to hand, and many jokes were made upon the ‘fair Helen’ whose\\nname was written on the paper cover which projected it.\\n\\n“‘I knew a Miss Harper once,--a lovely woman, but her name was not\\nHelen, and she is dead,--God bless her!’ I heard Mr. Warburton say,\\nas he flapped his straw hat to dry it, and rubbed his head, which\\nfortunately was well covered with thick gray hair at that time.\\n\\n“I longed to go down and tell him who I was, but I had not the\\ncourage to face all those men. It really was MOST embarrassing; so I\\nwaited for a more private moment to claim my book, as I knew we\\nshould not land till night, so there was no danger of losing it.\\n\\n“‘This is rather unusual stuff for a woman to be reading. Some\\nliterary lady doubtless. Better look her up, Warburton. You’ll know\\nher by the color of her stockings when she comes down to lunch,’\\nsaid a jolly old gentlenoan, in a tone that made me ‘rouge high,’ as\\nEvelina says.\\n\\n“‘I shall know her by her intelligent face and conversation, if this\\nbook belongs to a lady. It will be an honor and a pleasure to meet a\\nwoman who enjoys Wordsworth, for in my opinion he is one of our\\ntruest poets,’ answered Mr. Warburton, putting the book in his\\npocket, with a look and a tone that were most respectful and\\ncomforting to me just then.\\n\\n“I hoped he would examine the volume, for Lucretia’s and Lyman’s\\nnames were on the fly leaf, and that would be a delightful\\nintroduction for me. So I said nothing and bided my time, feeling\\nrather foolish when we all filed in to lunch, and I saw the other\\nparty glancing at the ladies at the table. Mr. Warburton’s eye\\npaused a moment as it passed from Mrs. Tracy to me, and I fear I\\nblushed like a girl, my dears, for Samuel had very fine eyes, and I\\nremembered the stout gentleman’s unseemly joke about the stockings.\\nMine were white as snow, for I had a neat foot, and was fond of nice\\nhose and well-made shoes. I am so still, as you see.” Here the old\\nlady displayed a small foot in a black silk stocking and delicate\\nslipper, with the artless pride a woman feels, at any age, in one of\\nher best points. The girls gratified her by a murmur of admiration,\\nand, decorously readjusting the folds of her gown, she went on with\\nthe most romantic episode of her quiet life.\\n\\n“I retired to my state-room after lunch to compose myself, and when\\nI emerged, in the cool of the afternoon, my first glance showed me\\nthat the hour had come, for there on deck was Mr. Warburton, talking\\nto Mrs. Tracy, with my book in his hand. I hesitated a moment, for\\nin spite of my age I was rather shy, and really it was not an easy\\nthing to apologize to a strange gentle-man for dropping books on\\nhis head and spoiling his hat. Men think so much of their hats you\\nknow. I was spared embarrassment, however, for he saw me and came to\\nme at once, saying, in the most cordial manner, as he showed the\\nnames on the fly leaf of my Wordsworth, ‘I am sure we need no other\\nintroduction but the names of these two dear friends of ours. I am\\nvery glad to find that Miss Helen Harper is the little girl I saw\\nonce or twice at your father’s house some years ago, and to meet her\\nso pleasantly again.’\\n\\n“That made everything easy and delightful, and when I had apologized\\nand been laughingly assured that he considered it rather an honor\\nthan otherwise to be assaulted by so great a man, we fell to talking\\nof old times, and soon forgot that we were strangers. He was twenty\\nyears older than I, but a handsome man, and a most interesting and\\nexcellent one, as we all know. He had lost a young wife long ago,\\nand had lived for science ever since, but it had not made him dry,\\nor cold, or selfish. He was very young at heart for all his wisdom,\\nand enjoyed that holiday like a boy out of school. So did I, and\\nnever dreamed that anything would come of it but a pleasant\\nfriendship founded on our love for those now dead and gone. Dear me!\\nhow strangely things turn out in this world of ours, and how the\\ndropping of that book changed my life! Well, that was our\\nintroduction, and that first long conversation was followed by many\\nmore equally charming, during the three weeks our parties were much\\ntogether, as both were taking the same trip, and Dr. Tracy was glad\\nto meet his old friend.\\n\\n“I need not tell you how delightful such society was to me, nor how\\nsurprised I was when, on the last day before we parted, Mr.\\nWarburton, who had answered many questions of mine during these long\\nchats of ours, asked me a very serious one, and I found that I could\\nanswer it as he wished. It brought me great honor as well as\\nhappiness. I fear I was not worthy of it, but I tried to be, and\\nfelt a tender satisfaction in thinking that I owed it to dear\\nLucretia, in part at least; for my effort to imitate her made me\\nfitter to become a wise man’s wife, and thirty years of very sweet\\ncompanionship was my reward.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton bowed her head before the portrait of a\\nvenerable old man which hung above the mantel-piece.\\n\\nIt was a pretty, old-fashioned expression of wifely pride and\\nwomanly tenderness in the fine old lady, who forgot her own gifts,\\nand felt only humility and gratitude to the man who had found in her\\na comrade in intellectual pursuits, as well as a helpmeet at home\\nand a gentle prop for his declining years.\\n\\nThe girls looked up with eyes full of something softer than mere\\ncuriosity, and felt in their young hearts how precious and honorable\\nsuch a memory must be, how true and beautiful such a marriage was,\\nand how sweet wisdom might become when it went hand in hand with\\nlove.\\n\\nAlice spoke first, saying, as she touched the worn cover of the\\nlittle book with a new sort of respect, “Thank you very much!\\nPerhaps I ought not to have taken this from the corner shelves in\\nyour sanctum? I wanted to find the rest of the lines Mr. Thornton\\nquoted last night, and didn’t stop to ask leave.”\\n\\n“You are welcome, my love, for you know how to treat books. Yes,\\nthose in that little case are my precious relics. I keep them all,\\nfrom my childish hymn-book to my great-grandfather’s brass-bound\\nBible, for by and by when I sit ‘Looking towards Sunset,’ as dear\\nLydia Maria Child calls our last days, I shall lose my interest in\\nother books, and take comfort in these. At the end as at the\\nbeginning of life we are all children again, and love the songs our\\nmothers sung us, and find the one true Book our best teacher as we\\ndraw near to God.”\\n\\nAs the reverent voice paused, a ray of sunshine broke through the\\nparting clouds, and shone full on the serene old face turned to meet\\nit, with a smile that welcomed the herald of a lovely sunset.\\n\\n“The rain is over; there will be just time for a run in the garden\\nbefore dinner, girls. I must go and change my cap, for literary\\nladies should not neglect to look well after the ways of their\\nhousehold and keep themseves tidy, no matter how old they may be.”\\n And with a nod Mrs. Warburton left them, wondering what the effect\\nof the conversation would be on the minds of her young guests.\\n\\nAlice went away to the garden, thinking of Lucretia and her lover,\\nas she gathered flowers in the sunshine. Conscientious Eva took the\\nLife of Mary Somerville to her room, and read diligently for half an\\nhour, that no time might be lost in her new course of study, Carrie\\nsent Wanda and her finery up the chimney in a lively blaze, and, as\\nshe watched the book burn, decided to take her blue and gold volume\\nof Tennyson with her on her next trip to Nahant, in case any\\neligible learned or literary man’s head should offer itself as a\\nshining mark. Since a good marriage was the end of life, why not\\nfollow Mrs. Warburton’s example, and make a really excellent one?\\n\\nWhen they all met at dinner-time the old lady was pleased to see a\\nnosegay of fresh pansies in the bosoms of her three youngest guests,\\nand to hear Alice whisper, with grateful eyes,--\\n\\n“We wear your flower to show you that we don’t mean to forget the\\nlesson you so kindly gave us, and to fortify ourselves with ‘noble\\nthoughts,’ as you and she did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWATER-LILIES\\n\\n\\nA PARTY of people, young and old, sat on the piazza of a seaside\\nhotel one summer morning, discussing plans for the day as they\\nwaited for the mail.\\n\\n“Hullo! here comes Christie Johnstone,” exclaimed one of the young\\nmen perched on the railing, who was poisoning the fresh air with the\\nsickly scent of a cigarette.\\n\\n“So ‘tis, with ‘Flucker, the baddish boy,’ in tow, as large as\\nlife,” added another, with a pleasant laugh as he turned to look.\\n\\nThe new-comers certainly looked somewhat like Charles Reade’s\\npicturesque pair, and every one watched them with idle interest as\\nthey drew nearer. A tall, robust girl of seventeen, with dark eyes\\nand hair, a fine color on her brown cheek, and vigor in every\\nmovement, came up the rocky path from the beach with a basket of\\nlobsters on one arm, of fish on the other, and a wicker tray of\\nwater-lilies on her head. The scarlet and silver of the fish\\ncontrasted prettily with the dark blue of her rough dress, and the\\npile of water flowers made a fitting crown for this bonny young\\nfish-wife. A sturdy lad of twelve came lurching after her in a pair\\nof very large rubber boots, with a dilapidated straw hat on the back\\nof his head and a pail on either arm.\\n\\nStraight on went the girl, never turning head or eyes as she passed\\nthe group on the piazza and vanished round the corner, though it was\\nevident that she heard the laugh the last speech produced, for the\\ncolor deepened in her cheeks and her step quickened. The boy,\\nhowever, returned the glances bent upon him, and answered the smiles\\nwith such a cheerful grin that the youth with the cigarette called\\nout,--\\n\\n“Good-morning, Skipper! Where do you hail from?”\\n\\n“Island, yender,” answered the boy, with a gesture of his thumb over\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\n“Oh, you are the lighthouse-keeper, are you?”\\n\\n“No, I ain’t; me and Gramper’s fishermen now.”\\n\\n“Your name is Flucker Johnstone, and your sister’s Christie, I\\nthink?” added the youth, enjoying the amusement of the young ladies\\nabout him.\\n\\n“It’s Sammy Bowen, and hern’s Ruth.”\\n\\n“Have you got a Boaz over there for her?”\\n\\n“No, we’ve got a devil-fish, a real whacker.”\\n\\nThis unexpected reply produced a roar from the gentlemen, while the\\nboy grinned good-naturedly, though without the least idea what the\\njoke was. Pretty Miss Ellery, who had been told that she had “a\\nrippling laugh,” rippled sweetly as she leaned over the railing to\\nask,\\n\\n“Are those lilies in your pails? I want some if they are for sale.”\\n\\n“Sister’ll fetch ‘em round when she’s left the lobs. I ain’t got\\nnone; this is bait for them fellers.” And, as if reminded of\\nbusiness by the yells of several boys who had just caught sight of\\nhim, Sammy abruptly weighed anchor and ran before the wind toward\\nthe stable.\\n\\n“Funny lot, these natives! Act as if they owned the place and are as\\nstupid as their own fish,” said the youth in the white yachting\\nsuit, as he flung away his cigarette end.\\n\\n“Don’t agree with you, Fred. I’ve known people of this sort all my\\nlife and a finer set of honest, hardworking, independent men I never\\nmet,--brave as lions and tender as women in spite of their rough\\nways,” answered the other young man, who wore blue flannel and had a\\ngold band on his cap.\\n\\n“Sailors and soldiers always stand by one another; so of course you\\nsee the best side of these fellows, Captain. The girls are fine\\ncreatures, I grant you; but their good looks don’t last long, more’s\\nthe pity!”\\n\\n“Few women’s would with the life they lead, so full of hard work,\\nsuspense, and sorrow. No one knows till one is tried, how much\\ncourage and faith it takes to keep young and happy when the men one\\nloves are on the great sea,” said a quiet, gray-haired lady, as she\\nlaid her hand on the knee of the young man in blue with a look that\\nmade him smile affectionately at her, with his own brown hand on\\nhers.\\n\\n“Shouldn’t wonder if Ben Bowen was laid up, since the girl brings\\nthe fish. He’s a fine old fellow. I’ve been to No Man’s Land many a\\ntime blue-fishing with him; must ask after him,” said an elderly\\ngentleman who was pacing to and fro yearning for the morning papers.\\n\\n“We might go over to the island and have a chowder-party or a\\nfish-fry some moonlight night. I haven’t been here for several\\nyears, but it used to be great fun, and I suppose we can do it now,”\\n suggested Miss Ellery with the laugh.\\n\\n“By Jove, we will! And look up Christie; ask her when she comes\\nround,” said Mr. Fred, the youthful dude, untwining his languid legs\\nas if the prospect put a little life into him.\\n\\n“Of course we pay for any trouble we give; these people will do\\nanything for money,” began Miss Ellery; but Captain John, as they\\ncalled the sailor, held up his hand with a warning, “Hush! she’s\\ncoming,” as Ruth’s weather-beaten brown hat turned the corner.\\n\\nShe paused a moment to drop the empty baskets, shake her skirts, and\\nput up a black braid that had fallen down; then, with the air of one\\nresolved to do a distasteful task as quickly as possible, she came\\nup the steps, held out the rough basket cover, and said in a clear\\nvoice,--\\n\\n“Would any of the ladies like some fresh lilies? Ten cents a bunch.”\\n\\nA murmur from the ladies expressed their admiration of the beautiful\\nflowers, and the gentlemen pressed forward to buy and present every\\nbunch with gallant haste. Ruth’s eyes shone as the money fell into\\nher hand, and several voices begged her to bring more lilies while\\nthey lasted.\\n\\n“I didn’t know the darlings would grow in salt water,” said Miss\\nEllery, as she fondly gazed upon the cluster Mr. Fred had just\\noffered her.\\n\\n“They don’t. There’s a little fresh-water pond on our island, and\\nthey grow there,--only place for miles round;” and Ruth looked at\\nthe delicate girl in ruffled white lawn and a mull hat, with a\\nglance of mingled pity for her ignorance and admiration for her\\nbeauty.\\n\\n“How silly of me! I am SUCH a goose;” and Miss Ellery gurgled as she\\nhid her face behind her red parasol.\\n\\n“Ask about the fish-fry,” whispered Mr. Fred, putting his head\\nbehind the rosy screen to assure the pretty creature that he didn’t\\nknow any better himself.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I will!” and, quite consoled, Miss Ellery called out,\\n“Girl, will you tell me if we can have chowder-parties on your rocks\\nas we used to a few seasons ago?”\\n\\n“If you bring your own fish. Grandpa is sick and can’t get ‘em for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“We will provide them, but who will cook them for us? It’s such\\nhorrid work.”\\n\\n“Any one can fry fish! I will if you want me to;” and Ruth half\\nsmiled, remembering that this girl who shuddered at the idea of pork\\nand a hot frying-pan, used to eat as heartily as any one when the\\ncrisp brown cunners were served up.\\n\\n“Very good; then we’ll engage you as cook, and come over to-night if\\nit’s clear and our fishing prospers. Don’t forget a dozen of the\\nfinest lilies for this lady to-morrow morning. Pay you now, may not\\nbe up;” and Mr. Fred dropped a bright silver dollar into the basket\\nwith a patronizing air, intended to impress this rather too\\nindependent young person with a proper sense of inferiority.\\n\\nRuth quietly shook the money out upon the door-mat, and said with a\\nsudden sparkle in her black eyes,--\\n\\n“It’s doubtful if I bring any more. Better wait till I do.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry your grandfather is sick. I’ll come over and see him\\nby-and-by, and bring the papers if he would like some,” said the\\nelderly gentleman as he came up with a friendly nod and real\\ninterest in his face.\\n\\n“Very much, thank you, sir. He is very feeble now;” and Ruth turned\\nwith a bright smile to welcome kind Mr. Wallace, who had not\\nforgotten the old man.\\n\\n“Christie has got a nice little temper of her own, and don’t know\\nhow to treat a fellow when he wants to do her a favor,” growled Mr.\\nFred, pocketing his dollar with a disgusted air.\\n\\n“She appears to know how to treat a gentleman when HE offers one,”\\n answered Blue Jacket, with a twinkle of the eye as if he enjoyed the\\nother’s discomfiture.\\n\\n“Girls of that class always put on airs if they are the least bit\\npretty,--so absurd!” said Miss Ellery, pulling up her long gloves as\\nshe glanced at the brown arms of the fisher maiden.\\n\\n“Girls of any class like to be treated with respect. Modesty in\\nlinsey-woolsey is as sweet as in muslin, my dear, and should be even\\nmore admired, according to my old-fashioned way of thinking,” said\\nthe gray-haired lady.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” murmured her sailor nephew with an approving nod.\\n\\nIt was evident that Ruth had heard also, as she turned to go, for\\nwith a quick gesture she pulled three great lilies from her hat and\\nlaid them on the old lady’s lap, saying with a grateful look, “Thank\\nyou, ma’am.”\\n\\nShe had seen Miss Scott hand her bunch to a meek little governess\\nwho had been forgotten, and this was all she had to offer in return\\nfor the kindness which is so sweet to poor girls whose sensitive\\npride gets often wounded by trifles like these.\\n\\nShe was going without her baskets when Captain John swung himself\\nover the railing, and ran after her with them. He touched his cap as\\nhe met her, and was thanked with as bright a smile as that the elder\\ngentleman had received; for his respectful “Miss Bowen” pleased her\\nmuch after the rude “Girl!” and the money tossed to her as if she\\nwere a beggar. When he came back the mail had arrived, and all\\nscattered at once,--Mr. Fred to spend the dollar in more cigarettes,\\nand Captain John to settle carefully in his button-hole the\\nwater-lily Aunt Mary gave him, before both young men went off to\\nplay tennis as if their bread depended on it.\\n\\nAs it bid fair to be a moonlight night, the party of a dozen young\\npeople, with Miss Scott and Mr. Wallace to act as matron and admiral\\nof the fleet, set off to the Island about sunset. Fish in abundance\\nhad been caught, and a picnic supper provided to be eaten on the\\nrocks when the proper time arrived. They found Sammy, in a clean\\nblue shirt and a hat less like a Feejee headpiece, willing to do the\\nhonors of the Island, beaming like a freckled young merman as he\\npaddled out to pull up the boats.\\n\\n“Fire’s all ready for kindlin’, and Ruth’s slicin’ the pertaters.\\nHope them fish is cleaned?” he added with a face of deep anxiety;\\nfor that weary task would fall to him if not already done, and the\\nthought desolated his boyish soul.\\n\\n“All ready, Sam! Lend a hand with these baskets, and then steer for\\nthe lighthouse; the ladies want to see that first,” answered Captain\\nJohn, as he tossed a stray cookie into Sammy’s mouth with a smile\\nthat caused that youth to cleave to him like a burr all the evening.\\n\\nThe young people scattered over the rocks, and hastened to visit the\\npoints of interest before dark. They climbed the lighthouse tower,\\nand paid Aunt Nabby and Grandpa a call at the weather-beaten little\\nhouse, where the old woman lent them a mammoth coffee-pot, and\\npromised that Ruth would “dish up them fish in good shape at eight\\npunctooal.” Then they strolled away to see the fresh-water pond\\nwhere the lilies grew.\\n\\n“How curious that such a thing should be here right in the middle of\\nthe salt sea!” said one of the girls, as they stood looking at the\\nquiet pool while the tide dashed high upon the rocks all about them.\\n\\n“Not more curious than how it is possible for anything so beautiful\\nand pure as one of those lilies to grow from the mud at the bottom\\nof the pond. The ugly yellow ones are not so out of place; but no\\none cares for them, and they smell horridly,” added another girl in\\na reflective tone.\\n\\n“Instinct sends the white lily straight up to the sun and air, and\\nthe strong slender stem anchors it to the rich earth below, out of\\nwhich it has power to draw the nourishment that makes it so lovely\\nand keeps it spotless--unless slugs and flies and boys spoil it,”\\n added Miss Scott as she watched Mr. Fred poke and splash with his\\ncane after a half-closed flower.\\n\\n“The naughty things have all shut up and spoilt the pretty sight;\\nI’m so disappointed,” sighed Miss Ellery, surveying the green buds\\nwith great disfavor as she had planned to wear some in her hair and\\nact Undine.\\n\\n“You must come early in the morning if you want to see them at their\\nbest. I’ve read somewhere that when the sun first strikes them they\\nopen rapidly, and it is a lovely sight. I shall try to see it some\\nday if I can get here in time,” said Miss Scott.\\n\\n“How romantic old maids are!” whispered one girl to another.\\n\\n“So are young ones; hear what Floss Ellery is saying,” answered the\\nother; and both giggled under their big hats as they caught these\\nwords followed by the rippling laugh,--\\n\\n“All flowers open and show their hearts when the sun shines on them\\nat the right moment.”\\n\\n“I wish human flowers would,” murmured Mr. Fred; and then, as if\\nrather alarmed at his own remark, he added hastily, “I’ll get that\\nbig lily out there and MAKE it bloom for you.”\\n\\nTrusting to an old log that lay in the pond, he went to the end and\\nbent to pull in the half-shut flower; but this too ardent sun was\\nnot to make it blossom, for his foot slipped and down he went up to\\nhis knees in mud and water.\\n\\n“Save him! oh, save him!” shrieked Miss Ellery, clutching Captain\\nJohn, who was laughing like a boy, while the other lads shouted and\\nthe girls added their shrill merriment as poor Fred scrambled to the\\nshore a wreck of the gallant craft that had set sail in spotless\\nwhite.\\n\\n“What the deuce shall I do?” he asked in a tone of despair as they\\nflocked about him to condole even while they laughed.\\n\\n“Roll up your trousers and borrow Sam’s boots. The old lady will dry\\nyour shoes and socks while you are at supper, and have them ready to\\nwear home,” suggested Captain John, who was used to duckings and\\nmade light of them.\\n\\nThe word “supper” made one carnal-minded youth sniff the air and\\nannounce that he smelt “something good;” and at once every one\\nturned toward the picnic ground, like chickens hurrying to the barn\\nat feeding-time. Fred vanished into the cottage, and the rest\\ngathered about the great fire of driftwood fast turning to clear\\ncoals, over which Ruth was beginning her long hot task. She wore a\\nbig apron, a red handkerchief over her head, had her sleeves rolled\\nup, and was so intent on her work that she merely nodded and smiled\\nas the new-comers greeted her with varying degrees of courtesy.\\n\\n“She looks like a handsome gypsy, with her dark face and that red\\nthing in the firelight. I wish I could paint her,” said Miss Scott,\\nwho was very young at heart in spite of her fifty years and gray\\nhead.\\n\\n“So do I, but we can remember it. I do like to see a girl work with\\na will, even at frying fish. Most of ‘em dawdle so at the few things\\nthey try to do. There’s a piece of energy for you!” and Captain John\\nleaned forward from his rocky seat to watch Ruth, who just then\\ncaught up the coffee-pot about to boil over, and with the other hand\\nsaved her frying-pan from capsizing on its unsteady bed of coals.\\n\\n“She is a nice girl, and I’m much interested in her. Mr. Wallace\\nsays he will tell us her story by-and-by if we care to hear it. He\\nhas known the old man a long time.”\\n\\n“Don’t forget to remind him, Aunty. I like a yarn after mess;” and\\nCaptain John went off to bring the first plate of fish to the dear\\nold lady who had been a mother to him for many years.\\n\\nIt was a merry supper, and the moon was up before it ended; for\\neverything “tasted so good” the hearty young appetites sharpened by\\nsea air were hard to satisfy. When the last cunner had vanished and\\nnothing but olives and oyster crackers remained, the party settled\\non a sloping rock out of range of the fire, and reposed for a brief\\nperiod to recover from the exertions of the feast, having, like the\\nheroes in the old story, “eaten mightily for the space of an hour.”\\n\\nMr. Fred in the capacious boots was a never-failing source of\\namusement, and consequently somewhat subdued. But Miss Ellery\\nconsoled him, and much food sustained him till his shoes were dry.\\nRuth remained to clear up, and Sammy to gorge himself on the\\nremnants of “sweet cake” which he could not bear to see wasted. So,\\nwhen some one proposed telling stories till they were ready to sing,\\nMr. Wallace was begged to begin.\\n\\n“It is only something about this island, but you may like to hear it\\njust now,” said the genial old gentleman, settling his handkerchief\\nover his bald head for fear of cold, and glancing at the attentive\\nyoung faces grouped about him in the moonlight.\\n\\n“Some twenty years ago there was a wreck over there on those great\\nrocks; you fellows have heard about it, so I’ll only say that a very\\nbrave sailor, a native of the Port here, swam out with a rope and\\nsaved a dozen men and women. I’ll call him Sam. Well, one of the\\nwomen was an English governess, and when the lady she was with went\\non her way after the wreck, this pretty girl (who by the way was a\\ngood deal hurt trying to save the child she had in charge) was left\\nbehind to recover, and--”\\n\\n“Marry the brave sailor of course,” cried one of the girls.\\n\\n“Exactly! and a very happy pair they were. She had no family who\\nwanted her at home; her father had been a clergyman, I believe, and\\nshe was well born, but Sam was a fine fellow and earned his living\\nhonestly, fishing off the Banks, as half the men do here. Well, they\\nwere very happy, had two children, and were saving up a bit, when\\npoor Sam and two brothers were lost in one of the great storms which\\nnow and then make widows and orphans by the dozen. It killed the\\nwife; but Sam’s father, who kept the lighthouse here then, took the\\npoor children and supported them for ten years. The boy was a mere\\nbaby; the girl a fine creature, brave like her father, handsome like\\nher mother, and with a good deal of the lady about her, though every\\none didn’t find it out.”\\n\\n“Ahem!” cried the sharp girl, who began to understand the point of\\nthe story now, but would not spoil it, as the others seemed still in\\nthe dark, though Miss Scott was smiling, and Captain John staring\\nhard at the old gentleman in the blue silk nightcap.\\n\\n“Got a fly in your throat?” asked a neighbor; but Kate only laughed\\nand begged pardon for interrupting.\\n\\n“There’s not much more; only that affair was rather romantic, and\\none can’t help wondering how the children turned out. Storms seem to\\nhave been their doom, for in the terrible one we had two winters\\nago, the old lighthouse keeper had a bad fall on the icy rocks, and\\nif it had not been for the girl, the light would have gone out and\\nmore ships been lost on this dangerous point. The keeper’s mate had\\ngone ashore and couldn’t get back for two days, the gale raged so\\nfiercely; but he knew Ben could get on without him, as he had the\\ngirl and boy over for a visit. In winter they lived with a friend\\nand went to school at the Port. It would have been all right if Ben\\nhadn’t broken his ribs. But he was a stout old salt; so he told the\\ngirl what to do, and she did it, while the boy waited on the sick\\nman. For two days and nights that brave creature lived in the tower,\\nthat often rocked as if it would come down, while the sleet and snow\\ndimmed the lantern, and sea-birds were beaten to death against the\\nglass. But the light burned steadily, and people said, ‘All is\\nwell,’ as ships steered away in time, when the clear light warned\\nthem of danger, and grateful sailors blessed the hands that kept it\\nburning faithfully.”\\n\\n“I hope she got rewarded,” cried an eager voice, as the story-teller\\npaused for breath.\\n\\n“‘I only did my duty; that is reward enough,’ she said, when some of\\nthe rich men at the Port heard of it and sent her money and thanks.\\nShe took the money, however, for Ben had to give up the place, being\\ntoo lame to do the work. He earns his living by fishing now, and\\nputs away most of his pension for the children. He won’t last long,\\nand then they must take care of themselves; for the old woman is no\\nrelation, and the girl is too proud to hunt up the forgetful English\\nfriends, if they have any. But I don’t fear for her; a brave lass\\nlike that will make her own way anywhere.”\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked several voices, as Mr. Wallace leaned back and\\nfanned himself with his hat.\\n\\n“That’s all of the first and second parts; the third is yet to come.\\nWhen I know it, I’ll tell you; perhaps next summer, if we meet here\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Then you know the girl? What is she doing now?” asked Miss Ellery,\\nwho had lost a part of the story as she sat in a shadowy nook with\\nthe pensive Fred.\\n\\n“We all know her. She is washing a coffee-pot at this moment, I\\nbelieve;” and Mr. Wallace pointed to a figure on the beach,\\nenergetically shaking a large tin article that shone in the\\nmoonlight.\\n\\n“Ruth? Really? How romantic and interesting!” exclaimed Miss Ellery,\\nwho was just of the age, as were most of the other girls, to enjoy\\ntales of this sort and imagine sensational denouements.\\n\\n“There is a great deal of untold romance in the lives of these\\ntoilers of the sea, and I am sure this good girl will find her\\nreward for the care she takes of the old man and the boy. It costs\\nher something, I’ve discovered, for she wants an education, and\\ncould get it if she left this poor place and lived for herself; but\\nshe won’t go, and works hard to get money for Grandpa’s comfort,\\ninstead of buying the books she longs for. I think, young ladies,\\nthat there is real heroism in cheerfully selling lilies and frying\\nfish for duty’s sake when one longs to be studying, and enjoying a\\nlittle of the youth that comes but once,” said Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes, so nice of her! We might take up a contribution for\\nher when we get home. I’ll head the paper with pleasure and give all\\nI can afford, for it must be so horrid to be ignorant at her age. I\\ndare say the poor thing can’t even read; just fancy!” and Miss\\nEllery clasped her hands with a sigh of pity.\\n\\n“Very few girls can read fit to be heard now-a-days,” murmured Miss\\nScott.\\n\\n“Don’t let them affront her with their money; she will fling it in\\ntheir faces as she did that donkey’s dollar. You see to her in your\\nnice, delicate way, Aunty, and give her a lift if she will let you,”\\n whispered Captain John in the old lady’s ear.\\n\\n“Don’t waste your pity, Miss Florence. Ruth reads a newspaper better\\nthan any woman I ever knew. I’ve heard her doing it to the old man,\\ngetting through shipping news, money-market, and politics in fine\\nstyle. I wouldn’t offer her money if I were you, though it is a kind\\nthought. These people have an honest pride in earning things for\\nthemselves, and I respect them for it,” added Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Dear me! I should as soon think of a sand skipper having pride as\\none of these fishy folks in this stupid little place,” observed Mr.\\nFred, moving his legs into the shadow as the creeping moonlight\\nbegan to reveal the hideous boots.\\n\\n“Why not? I think they have more to be proud of, these brave,\\nhonest, independent people, than many who never earn a cent and\\nswell round on the money their fathers made out of pork, rum,\\nor--any other rather unpleasant or disreputable business,” said\\nCaptain John, with the twinkle in his eye, as he changed the end of\\nhis sentence, for the word “pickles” was on his lips when Aunt\\nMary’s quick touch checked it. Some saucy girl laughed, and Mr. Fred\\nsquirmed, for it was well known that his respectable grandfather\\nwhom he never mentioned had made his large fortune in a\\npickle-factory.\\n\\n“We all rise from the mud in one sense, and all may be handsome\\nflowers if we choose before we go back, after blooming, to ripen our\\nseeds at the bottom of the water where we began,” said Miss Scott’s\\nrefined voice, sounding softly after the masculine ones.\\n\\n“I like that idea! Thank you, Aunt Mary, for giving me such a pretty\\nfancy to add to my love for water-lilies. I shall remember it, and\\ntry to be a lovely one, not a bit ashamed to own that I came from\\nhonest farmer stock,” exclaimed the thoughtful girl who had learned\\nto know and love the sweet, wise woman who was so motherly to all\\ngirls.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried Captain John, heartily; for he was very proud of\\nhis own brave name kept clean and bright through a long line of\\nsailor kin.\\n\\n“Now let us sing or we shall have no time,” suggested Miss Ellery,\\nwho warbled as well as rippled, and did not wish to lose this\\nopportunity of singing certain sentimental songs appropriate to the\\nhour.\\n\\nSo they tuned their pipes and made “music in the air” for an hour,\\nto the great delight of Sammy, who joined in every song, and was\\neasily persuaded to give sundry nautical melodies in a shrill small\\nvoice which convulsed his hearers with merriment.\\n\\n“Ruth sings awful well, but she won’t afore folks,” he said, as he\\npaused after a roaring ditty.\\n\\n“She will for me;” and Mr. Wallace went slowly up to the rock not\\nfar away, where Ruth sat alone listening to the music as she rested\\nafter her long day’s work.\\n\\n“Such airs!” said Miss Ellery, in a sharp tone; for her “Wind of the\\nSummer Night” had not gone well, owing to a too copious supper.\\n“Posing for Lorelei,” she added, as Ruth began to sing, glad to\\noblige the kind old gentleman. They expected some queer ballad or\\ndroning hymn, and were surprised when a clear sweet voice gave them\\n“The Three Fishers” and “Mary on the Sands of Dee” with a simple\\npathos that made real music-lovers thrill with pleasure, and filled\\nseveral pairs of eyes with tears.\\n\\n“More, please, more!” called Captain John, as she paused; and as if\\nencouraged by the hearty applause her one gift excited, she sang on\\nas easily as a bird till her small store was exhausted.\\n\\n“I call THAT music,” said Miss Scott, as she wiped her eyes with a\\nsigh of satisfaction. “It comes from the heart and goes to the\\nheart, as it should. Now we don’t want anything else, and had better\\ngo home while the spell lasts.”\\n\\nMost of the party followed her example, and went to thank and say\\ngood-night to Ruth, who felt as rich and happy as a queen with the\\nmoney Mr. Wallace had slipped into her pocket, and the pleasure\\nwhich even this short glimpse of a higher, happier life had brought\\nher hungry nature.\\n\\nAs the boats floated away, leaving her alone on the shore, she sent\\nher farewell ringing over the water in the words of the old song, “A\\nLife on the Ocean Wave;” and every one joined in it with a will,\\nespecially Mr. Wallace and Captain John; and so the evening picnic\\nended tunefully and pleasantly for all, and was long remembered by\\nseveral.\\n\\nAfter that day many “good times” came to Ruth and Sammy; and even\\npoor old Grandpa had his share, finding the last summer of his life\\nvery smooth sailing as he slowly drifted into port. It seemed quite\\nnatural that Captain John, being a sailor, should like to go and\\nread and “yarn” with the old fisherman; so no one wondered when he\\nfell into the way of rowing over to the Island very often with his\\npocket full of newspapers, and whiling away the long hours in the\\nlittle house as full of sea smells and salt breezes as a shell on\\nthe shore.\\n\\nMiss Scott also took a fancy to go with her nephew; for, being an\\nardent botanist, she discovered that the Island possessed many\\nplants which she could not find on the rocky point of land where the\\nhotel and cottages stood. The fresh-water pond was her especial\\ndelight, and it became a sort of joke to ask, when she came home\\nbrown and beaming with her treasures in tin boxes, bottles, and\\nbunches,--\\n\\n“Well, Aunt Mary, have you seen the water-lilies bloom yet?” and\\nshe always answered with that wise smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Not yet, but I’m biding my time, and am watching a very fine one\\nwith especial interest. When the right moment comes, it will bloom\\nand show its golden heart to me, I hope.”\\n\\nRuth never quite knew how it came about, but books seemed to find\\ntheir way to the Island and stay there, to her great delight. A\\ndemand for lilies sprang up, and when their day was over\\nmarsh-rosemary became the rage. Sammy found a market for all the\\nshells and gulls’ wings he could furnish, and certain old\\ncuriosities brought from many voyages were sold for sums which added\\nmany comforts to the old sailor’s last cruise.\\n\\nNow the daily row to the Point was a pleasure, not a trial, to\\nRuth,--for Mr. Wallace was always ready with a kind word or gift,\\nthe ladies nodded as she passed, and asked how the old Skipper was\\nto-day; Miss Scott often told her to stop at the cottage for some\\nnew book or a moment’s chat on her way to the boat, and Captain John\\nhelped Sammy with his fishing so much that the baskets were always\\nfull when they came home.\\n\\nAll this help and friendliness put a wonderful energy and sweetness\\ninto Ruth’s hard life, and made her work seem light, her patient\\nwaiting for freedom easier to bear cheerfully. She sang as she stood\\nover her wash-tub, cheered the long nights of watching with the\\nprecious books, and found the few moments of rest that came to her\\nwhen the day’s work was done very pleasant, as she sat on her rock,\\nwatching the lights from the Point, catching the sound of gay music\\nas the young people danced, and thinking over the delightful talks\\nshe had with Miss Scott. Perhaps the presence of a blue jacket in\\nGrandpa’s little bedroom, the sight of a friendly brown face smiling\\nwhen she came in, and the sonorous murmur of a man’s voice reading\\naloud, added a charm to the girl’s humdrum life. She was too\\ninnocent and frank to deny that she enjoyed these new friends, and\\nwelcomed both with the same eagerness, saw both go with the same\\nregret, and often wondered how she ever had got on without them.\\n\\nBut the modest fisher-maiden never dreamed of any warmer feeling\\nthan kindness on the one side and gratitude on the other; and this\\nunconsciousness was her greatest charm, especially to Captain John,\\nwho hated coquettes, and shunned the silly girls who wasted time in\\nidle flirtation when they had far better and wholesomer pastimes to\\nenjoy. The handsome sailor was a favorite, being handy at all sorts\\nof fun, and the oldest of the young men at the Point. He was very\\ncourteous in his hearty way to every woman he met, from the\\nstateliest dowager to the dowdiest waiter-girl, but devoted himself\\nentirely to Aunt Mary, and seemed to have no eyes for younger fairer\\nfaces.\\n\\n“He must have a sweetheart over the sea somewhere,” the damsels said\\namong themselves, as they watched him pace the long piazzas alone,\\nor saw him swinging in his hammock with eyes dreamily fixed on the\\nblue bay before him.\\n\\nMiss Scott only smiled when curious questions were asked her, and\\nsaid she hoped John would find his mate some time, for he deserved\\nthe best wife in the world, having been a good son and an honest boy\\nfor six-and-twenty years.\\n\\n“What is it, Captain,--a steamer?” asked Mr. Fred, as he came by the\\ncottage one August afternoon, with his usual escort of girls, all\\ntalking at once about some very interesting affair.\\n\\n“Only a sail-boat; no steamers to-day,” answered Captain John,\\ndropping the glass from his eye with a start.\\n\\n“Can you see people on the Island with that thing? We want to know\\nif Ruth is at home, because if she isn’t we can’t waste time going\\nover,” said Miss Ellery, with her sweetest smile.\\n\\n“I think not. That boat is Sammy’s, and as there is a speck of red\\naboard, I fancy Miss Ruth is with him. They are coming this way, so\\nyou can hail them if you like,” answered the sailor, with “a speck\\nof red” on his own sunburnt cheek if any one had cared to look.\\n\\n“Then we’ll wait here if we may. We ordered her to bring us a\\nquantity of bulrushes and flowers for our tableaux to-night, and we\\nwant her to be Rebecca at the well. She is so dark, and with her\\nhair down, and gold bangles and scarlet shawls, I think she would do\\nnicely. It takes so long to arrange the ‘Lily Maid of Astolat’ we\\nMUST have an easy one to come just before that, and the boys are\\nwild to make a camel of themselves, so we planned this. Won’t you be\\nJacob or Abraham or whoever the man with the bracelets was?” asked\\nMiss Ellery, as they all settled on the steps in the free-and-easy\\nway which prevailed at the Point.\\n\\n“No, thank you, I don’t act. Used to dance hornpipes in my young\\ndays, but gave up that sort of thing some time ago.”\\n\\n“How unfortunate! Every one acts; it’s all the fashion,” began Miss\\nEllery, rolling up her blue eyes imploringly.\\n\\n“So I see; but I never cared much for theatricals, I like natural\\nthings better.”\\n\\n“How unkind you are! I quite depended on you for that, since you\\nwouldn’t be a corsair.”\\n\\n“Fred’s the man for such fun. He’s going to startle the crowd with a\\nregular Captain Kidd rig, pistols and cutlasses enough for a whole\\ncrew, and a terrific beard.”\\n\\n“I know Ruth won’t do it, Floss, for she looked amazed when I showed\\nher my Undine costume, and told her what I wanted the sea-weed for.\\n‘Why, you won’t stand before all those folks dressed that way, will\\nyou?’ she said, as much scandalized as if she’d never seen a\\nlow-necked dress and silk stockings before;” and Miss Perry tossed\\nher head with an air of pity for a girl who could be surprised at\\nthe display of a pretty neck and arms and ankles.\\n\\n“We’ll HIRE her, then; she’s a mercenary wretch and will do anything\\nfor money. I won’t be scrambled into my boat in a hurry, and we MUST\\nhave Rebecca because I’ve borrowed a fine pitcher and promised the\\nboys their camel,” said Miss Ellery, who considered herself the\\nqueen of the place and ruled like one, in virtue of being the\\nprettiest girl there and the richest.\\n\\n“She has landed, I think, for the boat is off again to the wharf.\\nBetter run down and help her with the bulrushes, Fred, and the rest\\nof the stuff you ordered,” suggested Captain John, longing to go\\nhimself but kept by his duty as host, Aunt Mary being asleep\\nupstairs.\\n\\n“Too tired. Won’t hurt her; she’s used to work, and we mustn’t\\npamper her up, as old ladies say,” answered Mr. Fred, enjoying his\\nfavorite lounge on the grass.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t ask her to act, if you’ll allow me to say so,” said\\nCaptain John, in his quiet way. “That sort of thing might unsettle\\nher and make her discontented. She steers that little craft over\\nthere and is happy now; let her shape her own course, and remember\\nit isn’t well to talk to the man at the wheel.”\\n\\nMiss Perry stared; Miss Ray, the sharp girl, nodded, and Miss Ellery\\nsaid petulantly,--\\n\\n“As if it mattered what SHE thought or said or did! It’s her place\\nto be useful if we want her, and we needn’t worry about spoiling a\\ngirl like that. She can’t be any prouder or more saucy than she is,\\nand I shall ask her if only to see the airs she will put on.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ruth came up the sandy path from the beach laden with\\nrushes and weeds, sun-flowers and shells, looking warm and tired\\nbut more picturesque than ever, in her blue gown and the red\\nhandkerchief she wore since her old hat blew away. Seeing the party\\non the cottage steps, she stopped to ask if the things were right,\\nand Miss Ellery at once made her request in a commanding tone which\\ncaused Ruth to grow very straight and cool and sober all at once,\\nand answer decidedly,--\\n\\n“I couldn’t anyway.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Well, one reason is I don’t think it’s right to act things out of\\nthe Bible just to show off and amuse folks.”\\n\\n“The idea of minding!” and Miss Ellery frowned, adding angrily, “We\\nwill pay you for it. I find people will do anything for money down\\nhere.”\\n\\n“We are poor and need it, and this is our best time to make it. I’d\\ndo most anything to earn a little, but not that;” and Ruth looked as\\nproud as the young lady herself.\\n\\n“Then we’ll say no more if you are too elegant to do what WE don’t\\nmind at all. I’ll pay you for this stuff now, as I ordered it, and\\nyou needn’t bring me any more. How much do I owe you?” asked the\\noffended beauty, taking out her purse in a pet.\\n\\n“Nothing. I’m glad to oblige the ladies if I can, for they have been\\nvery kind to me. Perhaps if you knew why I want to earn money, you’d\\nunderstand me better. Grandpa can’t last long, and I don’t want the\\ntown to bury him. I’m working and saving so he can be buried\\ndecently, as he wants to be, not like a pauper.”\\n\\nThere was something in Ruth’s face and voice as she said this,\\nstanding there shabby, tired, and heavy-laden, yet honest, dutiful\\nand patient for love’s sake, that touched the hearts of those who\\nlooked and listened; but she left no time for any answer, for with\\nthe last word she went on quickly, as if to hide the tears that\\ndimmed her clear eyes and the quiver of her lips.\\n\\n“Floss, how could you!” cried Miss Ray, and ran to take the sheaf of\\nbulrushes from Ruth’s arms, followed by the rest, all ashamed and\\nrepentant now that a word had shown them the hard life going on\\nbeside their idle, care-free ones.\\n\\nCaptain John longed to follow, but walked into the house, growling\\nto himself with a grim look,--\\n\\n“That girl has no more heart than a butterfly, and I’d like to see\\nher squirm on a pin! Poor Ruth! we’ll settle that matter, and bury\\nold Ben like an admiral, hang me if we don’t!”\\n\\nHe was so busy talking the affair over with Aunt Mary that he did\\nnot see the girl flit by to wait for her boat on the beach, having\\nsteadily refused the money offered her, though she accepted the\\napologies in the kindest spirit.\\n\\nThe beach at this hour of the day was left to the nurses and maids\\nwho bathed and gossiped while the little people played in the sand\\nor paddled in the sea. Several were splashing about, and one German\\ngoverness was scolding violently because while she was in the\\nbath-house her charge, a little girl of six, had rashly ventured out\\nin a flat-bottomed tub, as they called the small boats used by the\\ngentlemen to reach the yachts anchored in deep water.\\n\\nRuth saw the child’s danger at a glance, for the tide was going out,\\ncarrying the frail cockleshell rapidly away, while the child risked\\nan upset every moment by stretching her arms to the women on the\\nshore and calling them to help her.\\n\\nNone dared to try, but all stood and wrung their hands, screaming\\nlike sea-gulls, till the girl, throwing off shoes and heavy skirt\\nplunged in, calling cheerily, “Sit still! I’ll come and get you,\\nMilly!”\\n\\nShe could swim like a fish, but encumbered with her clothes and\\nweary with an unusually hard day’s work, she soon found that she did\\nnot gain as rapidly as she expected upon the receding boat. She did\\nnot lose courage, but a thrill of anxiety shot through her as she\\nfelt her breath grow short, her limbs heavy, and the tide sweep her\\nfarther and farther from the shore.\\n\\n“If they would only stop screaming and go for help, I could keep up\\nand push the boat in; but the child will be out presently and then\\nwe are lost, for I can’t get back with her, I’m afraid.”\\n\\nAs these thoughts passed through her mind Ruth was swimming stoutly,\\nand trying by cheerful words to keep the frightened child from\\nrisking their main chance of safety. A few more strokes and she\\nwould reach the boat, rest a moment, then, clinging to it, push it\\nleisurely to shore. Feeling that the danger was over, she hurried on\\nand was just putting up her hands to seize the frail raft and get\\nher breath when Milly, thinking she was to be taken in her arms,\\nleaned forward. In rushed the water, down went the boat, and out\\nsplashed the screaming child to cling to Ruth with the desperate\\nclutch she dreaded.\\n\\nBoth went under for a moment, but rose again; and with all her wits\\nsharpened by the peril of the moment, Ruth cried, as she kept\\nherself afloat,--\\n\\n“On my back, quick! quick! Don’t touch my arms; hold tight to my\\nhair, and keep still.”\\n\\nNot realizing all the danger, and full of faith in Ruth’s power to\\ndo anything, after the feats of diving and floating she had seen her\\nperform, Milly scrambled up as often before, and clung spluttering\\nand gasping to Ruth’s strong shoulders. So burdened, and conscious\\nof fast-failing strength, Ruth turned toward the shore, and bent\\nevery power of mind and body to her task. How far away it seemed!\\nhow still the women were,--not one even venturing out a little way\\nto help her, and no man in sight! Her heart seemed to stop beating,\\nher temples throbbed, her breath was checked by the clinging arms,\\nand the child, seemed to grow heavier every moment.\\n\\n“I’ll do what I can, but, oh, why don’t some one come?”\\n\\nThat was the last thought Ruth was conscious of, as she panted and\\nploughed slowly back, with such a set white face and wide eyes fixed\\non the flag that fluttered from the nearest cottage, that it was no\\nwonder the women grew still as they watched her. One good Catholic\\nnurse fell on her knees to pray; the maids cried, the governess\\nmurmured, “Mein Gott, I am lost if the child go drowned!” and clear\\nand sweet came the sound of Captain John’s whistle as he stood on\\nhis piazza waiting to row Ruth home.\\n\\nThey were nearly in, a few more strokes and she could touch the\\nbottom, when suddenly all grew black before her eyes, and\\nwhispering, “I’ll float. Call, Milly, and don’t mind me,” Ruth\\nturned over, still holding the child fast, and with nothing but her\\nface out of water, feebly struggled on.\\n\\n“Come and get me! She’s going down! Oh, come, quick!” called the\\nchild in a tone of such distress that the selfish German bestirred\\nherself at last, and began to wade cautiously in. Seeing help at\\nhand, brave little Milly soon let go, and struck out like an\\nenergetic young frog, while Ruth, quite spent, sank quietly down,\\nwith a dim sense that her last duty was done and rest had come.\\n\\nThe shrill cries of the women when they saw the steady white face\\ndisappear and rise no more, reached Captain John’s ear, and sent him\\nflying down the path, sure that some one was in danger.\\n\\n“Ruth--gone down--out there!” was all he caught, as many voices\\ntried to tell the tale; and waiting for no more, he threw off hat\\nand coat, and dashed into the sea as if ready to search the Atlantic\\ntill he found her.\\n\\nShe was safe in a moment, and pausing only to send one girl flying\\nfor the doctor, he carried his streaming burden straight home to\\nAunt Mary, who had her between blankets before a soul arrived, and\\nwas rubbing for dear life while John fired up the spirit lamp for\\nhot brandy and water, with hands that trembled as he splashed about\\nlike an agitated Newfoundland fresh from a swim.\\n\\nRuth was soon conscious, but too much exhausted to do or say\\nanything, and lay quietly suffering the discomforts of resuscitation\\ntill she fell asleep.\\n\\n“Is Milly safe?” was all she asked, and being assured that the child\\nwas in her mother’s arms, and Sammy had gone to tell Grandpa all\\nabout it, she smiled and shut her eyes with a whispered, “Then it’s\\nall right, thank God!”\\n\\nAll that evening Captain John paced the piazza, and warned away the\\neager callers, who flocked down to ask about the heroine of the\\nhour; for she was more interesting than Undine, the Lily Maid, or\\nany of the pretty creatures attitudinizing behind the red curtains\\nin the hot hotel parlor. All that night Aunt Mary watched the deep\\nsleep that restored the girl, and now and then crept out to tell her\\nnephew there was nothing to fear for one so strong and healthful.\\nAnd all night Ruth dreamed strange dreams, some weird and dim, some\\nfull of pain and fear; but as the fever of reaction passed away,\\nlovely visions of a happy place came to her, where faces she loved\\nwere near, and rest, and all she longed for was hers at last. So\\nclear and beautiful was this dream that she waked in the early dawn\\nto lie and think of it, with such a look of peace upon her face that\\nAunt Mary could not but kiss it tenderly when she came in to see if\\nall was well.\\n\\n“How are you, dear? Has this nice long sleep set you up again as I\\nhoped?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’m quite well, thank you, and I must go home. Grandpa will\\nworry so till he sees me,” answered Ruth, sitting up with her wet\\nhair on her shoulders, and a little shiver of pain as she stretched\\nher tired arms.\\n\\n“Not yet, my dear; rest another hour or two and have some breakfast.\\nThen, if you like, John shall take you home before any one comes to\\nplague you with idle questions. I’m not going to say a word, except\\nthat I’m proud of my brave girl, and mean to take care of her if she\\nwill let me.”\\n\\nWith that and a motherly embrace, the old lady bustled away to stir\\nup her maid and wake John from his first nap with the smell of\\ncoffee, a most unromantic but satisfying perfume to all the weary\\nwatchers in the house.\\n\\nAn hour later, dressed in Miss Scott’s gray wrapper and rose-colored\\nshawl, Ruth came slowly to the beach leaning on Captain John’s arm,\\nwhile Aunt Mary waved her napkin from the rocks above, and sent kind\\nmessages after them as they pushed off.\\n\\nIt was the loveliest hour of all the day. The sun had not yet risen,\\nbut sea and sky were rosy with the flush of dawn; the small waves\\nrippled up the sand, the wind blew fresh and fragrant from hayfields\\nfar away, and in the grove the birds were singing, as they only sing\\nat peep of day. A still, soft, happy time before the work and worry\\nof the world began, the peaceful moment which is so precious to\\nthose who have learned to love its balm and consecrate its beauty\\nwith their prayers.\\n\\nRuth sat silent, looking about her as if she saw a new heaven and\\nearth, and had no words in which to tell the feeling that made her\\neyes so soft, sent the fresh color back into her cheeks, and touched\\nher lips with something sweeter than a smile.\\n\\nCaptain John rowed very slowly, watching her with a new expression\\nin his face; and when she drew a long breath, a happy sort of sigh,\\nhe leaned forward to ask, as if he knew what brought it,--\\n\\n“You are glad to be alive, Ruth?”\\n\\n“Oh, so glad! I didn’t want to die; life’s very pleasant now,” she\\nanswered, with her frank eyes meeting his so gratefully.\\n\\n“Even though it’s hard?”\\n\\n“It’s easier lately; you and dear Miss Mary have helped so much, I\\nsee my way clear, and mean to go right on, real brave and cheerful,\\nsure I’ll get my wish at last.”\\n\\n“So do I!” and Captain John laughed a queer, happy laugh, as he bent\\nto his oars again, with the look of a man who knew where he was\\ngoing and longed to get there as soon as possible.\\n\\n“I hope you will. I wish I could help anyway to pay for all you’ve\\ndone for me. I know you don’t want to be thanked for fishing me up,\\nbut I mean to do it all the same, if I can, some time;” and Ruth’s\\nvoice was full of tender energy as she looked down into the deep\\ngreen water where her life would have ended but for him.\\n\\n“What did you think of when you went down so quietly? Those women\\nsaid you never called for help once.”\\n\\n“I had no breath to call. I knew you were near, I hoped you’d come,\\nand I thought of poor Grandpa and Sammy as I gave up and seemed to\\ngo to sleep.”\\n\\nA very simple answer, but it made Captain John beam with delight;\\nand the morning red seemed to glow all over his brown face as he\\nrowed across the quiet bay, looking at Ruth sitting opposite, so\\nchanged by the soft becoming colors of her dress, the late danger,\\nand the dreams that still lingered in her mind, making it hard to\\nfeel that she was the same girl who went that way only a day ago.\\n\\nPresently the Captain spoke again in a tone that was both eager and\\nanxious,--\\n\\n“I’m glad my idle summer hasn’t been quite wasted. It’s over now,\\nand I’m off in a few days for a year’s cruise, you know.”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Mary told me you were going soon. I’ll miss you both, but\\nmaybe you’ll come next year?”\\n\\n“I will, please God!”\\n\\n“So will I; for even if I get away this fall, I’d love to come again\\nin summer and rest a little while, no matter what I find to do.”\\n\\n“Come and stay with Aunt Mary if this home is gone. I shall want\\nSammy next time. I’ve settled that with the Skipper, you know, and\\nI’ll take good care of the little chap. He’s not much younger than I\\nwas when I shipped for my first voyage. You’ll let him go?”\\n\\n“Anywhere with you. He’s set his heart on being a sailor, and\\nGrandpa likes it. All our men are, and I’d be one if I were a boy. I\\nlove the sea so, I couldn’t be happy long away from it.”\\n\\n“Even though it nearly drowned you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I’d rather die that way than any other. But it was my fault; I\\nshouldn’t have failed if I hadn’t been so tired. I’ve often swum\\nfarther; but I’d been three hours in the marsh getting those things\\nfor the girls, and it was washing-day, and I’d been up nearly all\\nnight with Grandpa; so don’t blame the sea, please, Captain John.”\\n\\n“You should have called me; I was waiting for you, Ruth.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know it. I’m used to doing things myself. It might have\\nbeen too late for Milly if I’d waited.”\\n\\n“Thank God, I wasn’t too late for you.”\\n\\nThe boat was at the shore now; and as he spoke Captain John held out\\nhis hands to help Ruth down, for, encumbered with her long dress,\\nand still weak from past suffering, she could not spring to land as\\nshe used to do in her short gown. For the first time the color\\ndeepened in her cheek as she looked into the face before her and\\nread the meaning of the eyes that found her beautiful and dear, and\\nthe lips that thanked God for her salvation so fervently.\\n\\nShe did not speak, but let him lift her down, draw her hand through\\nhis arm, and lead her up the rocky slope to the little pool that lay\\nwaiting for the sun’s first rays to wake from its sleep. He paused\\nthere, and with his hand on hers said quietly,--\\n\\n“Ruth, before I go I want to tell you something, and this is a good\\ntime and place. While Aunt Mary watched the flowers, I’ve watched\\nyou, and found the girl I’ve always wanted for my wife. Modest and\\nbrave, dutiful and true, that’s what I love; could you give me all\\nthis, dear, for the little I can offer, and next year sail with\\nSammy and a very happy man if you say yes?”\\n\\n“I’m not half good and wise enough for that! Remember what I am,”\\n began Ruth, bending her head as if the thought were more than she\\ncould bear.\\n\\n“I do remember, and I’m proud of it! Why, dear heart, I’ve worked my\\nway up from a common sailor, and am the better for it. Now I’ve got\\nmy ship, and I want a mate to make a home for me aboard and ashore.\\nLook up and tell me that I didn’t read those true eyes wrong.”\\n\\nThen Ruth lifted up her face, and the sunshine showed him all he\\nasked to know, as she answered with her heart in her voice and the\\n“true eyes” fixed on his,--\\n\\n“I tried not to love you, knowing what a poor ignorant girl I am;\\nbut you were so kind to me, how could I help it, John?”\\n\\nThat satisfied him, and he sealed his happy thanks on the innocent\\nlips none had kissed but the little brother, the old man, and the\\nfresh winds of the sea.\\n\\nOne can imagine the welcome they met at the small brown house, and\\nwhat went on inside as Grandpa blessed the lovers, and Sammy so\\noverflowed with joy at his enchanting prospects, that he was obliged\\nto vent his feelings in ecstatic jigs upon the beach, to the great\\namazement of the gulls and sandpipers at breakfast there.\\n\\nNo one at the Point, except a certain dear old lady, knew the\\npleasant secret, though many curious or friendly visitors went to\\nthe Island that day to see the heroine and express their wonder,\\nthanks, and admiration. All agreed that partial drowning seemed to\\nsuit the girl, for a new Ruth had risen like Venus from the sea. A\\nsofter beauty was in her fresh face now, a gentler sort of pride\\npossessed her, and a still more modest shrinking from praise and\\npublicity became her well. No one guessed the cause, and she was\\nsoon forgotten; for the season was over, the summer guests departed,\\nand the Point was left to the few cottagers who loved to linger into\\ngolden September.\\n\\nMiss Mary was one of these, and Captain John another; for he\\nremained as long as he dared, to make things comfortable for the old\\nman, and to sit among the rocks with Ruth when her day’s work was\\ndone, listening while his “Mermaid,” as he called her, sang as she\\nhad never sung before, and let him read the heart he had made his\\nown, for the lily was wide open now, and its gold all his.\\n\\nWith the first frosts Grandpa died, and was carried to his grave by\\nhis old comrades, owing no man a cent, thanks to his dutiful\\ngranddaughter and the new son she had given him. Then the little\\nhouse was deserted, and all winter Ruth was happy with Aunt Mary,\\nwhile Sammy studied bravely, and lived on dreams of the joys in\\nstore for him when the Captain came sailing home again.\\n\\nAnother summer brought the happy day when the little brown house was\\nset in order for a sailor’s honeymoon, when the flag floated gayly\\nover Miss Mary’s cottage, and Ruth in a white gown with her chosen\\nflowers in her hair and bosom, shipped with her dear Captain for the\\nlong cruise which had its storms and calms, but never any shipwreck\\nof the love that grew and blossomed with the water-lilies by the\\nsea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOPPIES AND WHEAT\\n\\n\\nAS the great steamer swung round into the stream the cloud of white\\nhandkerchiefs waving on the wharf melted away, the last good-byes\\ngrew fainter, and those who went and those who stayed felt that the\\nparting was over,--\\n\\n“It may be for years, and it may be forever,”\\n\\nas the song says.\\n\\nWith only one of the many groups on the deck need we concern\\nourselves, and a few words will introduce our fellow-travellers. A\\nbrisk middle-aged lady leaned on the arm of a middle-aged gentleman\\nin spectacles, both wearing the calmly cheerful air of people used\\nto such scenes, and conscious only of the relief change of place\\nbrings to active minds and busy lives.\\n\\nBefore them stood two girls, evidently their charges, and as\\nevidently not sisters, for in all respects they were a great\\ncontrast. The younger was a gay creature of seventeen, in an\\neffective costume of navy-blue and white, with bright hair blowing\\nin the wind, sparkling eyes roving everywhere, lively tongue going,\\nand an air of girlish excitement pleasant to see. Both hands were\\nfull of farewell bouquets, which she surveyed with more pride than\\ntenderness as she glanced at another group of girls less blessed\\nwith floral offerings.\\n\\nHer companion was a small, quiet person, some years older than\\nherself, very simply dressed, laden with wraps, and apparently\\nconscious just then of nothing but three dark specks on the wharf,\\nas she still waved her little white flag, and looked shoreward with\\neyes too dim for seeing. A sweet, modest face it was, with\\nintelligent eyes, a firm mouth, and the look of one who had early\\nlearned self-reliance and self-control.\\n\\nThe lady and gentleman watched the pair with interest and amusement;\\nfor both liked young people, and were anxious to know these two\\nbetter, since they were to be their guides and guardians for six\\nmonths. Professor Homer was going abroad to look up certain\\nimportant facts for his great historical work, and as usual took his\\nwife with him; for they had no family, and the good lady was ready\\nto march to any quarter of the globe at short notice. Fearing to be\\nlonely while her husband pored over old papers in foreign libraries,\\nMrs. Homer had invited Ethel Amory, a friend’s daughter, to\\naccompany her. Of course the invitation was gladly accepted, for it\\nwas a rare opportunity to travel in such company, and Ethel was wild\\nwith delight at the idea. One thorn, however, vexed her, among\\nthe roses with which her way seemed strewn. Mamma would not let her\\ntake a French maid, but preferred a young lady as companion; for,\\nthree being an awkward number, a fourth party would be not only\\nconvenient, but necessary on the girl’s account, since she was not\\nused to take care of herself and Mrs. Homer could only be expected\\nto act as chaperone.\\n\\n“Jane Bassett is just the person I want, and Jane shall go. She\\nneeds a change after teaching all these years; it will do her a\\nworld of good, for she will improve and enjoy every moment, and the\\nsalary I shall offer her will make it worth her while,” said Mrs.\\nAmory, as she discussed the plan with her daughter.\\n\\n“She is only three years older than I am, and I hate to be taken\\ncare of, and watched, and fussed over. I can order a maid round, but\\na companion is worse than a governess; such people are always\\nsensitive and proud, and hard to get on with. Every one takes a\\nmaid, and I’d set my heart on that nice Marie who wants to go home,\\nand talks such lovely French. Do let me have her, Mamma!” begged\\nEthel, who was a spoiled child and usually got her own way.\\n\\nBut for once Mamma stood firm, having a strong desire to benefit her\\ndaughter by the society of better companions than the gay girls of\\nher own set, also to give a great pleasure to good little Jane\\nBassett, who had been governessing ever since she was sixteen, with\\nvery few vacations in her hard, dutiful life.\\n\\n“No, darling, I have asked Jane, and if her mother can spare her,\\nJane it shall be. She is just what you need,--sensible and kind,\\nintelligent and capable; not ashamed to do anything for you, and\\nable to teach you a great deal in a pleasant way. Mrs. Homer\\napproves of her, and I am sure you will be glad by-and-by; for\\ntravelling is not all ‘fun,’ as you expect, and I don’t want you to\\nbe a burden on our friends. You two young things can take care of\\neach other while the Professor and his wife are busy with their own\\naffairs; and Jane is a far better companion for you than that\\ncoquettish French woman, who will probably leave you in the lurch as\\nsoon as you reach Paris. I shouldn’t have a moment’s peace if you\\nwere left with her, but I have entire confidence in Jane Bassett\\nbecause she is faithful, discreet, and a true lady in all things.”\\n\\nThere was no more to be said, and Ethel pouted in vain. Jane\\naccepted the place with joy; and after a month of delightful hurry\\nthey were off, one all eagerness for the new world, the other full\\nof tender regret for the dear souls left behind. How they got on,\\nand what they learned, remains to be told.\\n\\n“Come, Miss Bassett, we can’t see them any longer, so we may as well\\nbegin to enjoy ourselves. You might take those things down below,\\nand settle the stateroom a bit; I’m going to walk about and get my\\nbearings before lunch. You will find me somewhere round.”\\n\\nEthel spoke with a little tone of command, having made up her mind\\nto be mistress and keep Jane Bassett in her place, though she did\\nknow three languages and sketched much better than Miss Amory.\\n\\nJenny, as we who are going to be her bosom friends will call her,\\nnodded cheerfully, and looked about for the stairway; for, never\\nhaving been on a steamer before, she was rather bewildered.\\n\\n“I’ll show you the way, my dear. I always get my things settled at\\nonce, as one never knows when one may have to turn in. The Professor\\nwill go with you, Ethel; it is not proper for you to roam about\\nalone;” and with that hint Mrs. Homer led the way below, privately\\nwondering how these young persons were going to get on together.\\n\\nJane swallowed her “heimweh” in silence, and bestirred herself so\\nwell that soon the stateroom looked very cosy with the wrappers laid\\nready, the hanging bags tacked up, and all made ship-shape for the\\nten days’ trip.\\n\\n“But where are YOUR comforts? You have given Ethel all the room, the\\nlower berth, and the best of everything,” said Mrs. Homer, popping\\nin her head to see how her quiet neighbor got on.\\n\\n“Oh, I live in my trunk; I didn’t bring half as many little luxuries\\nas Ethel did, so I don’t need as much room. I’m used to living in\\ncorners like a mouse, and I get on very well,” answered Jane,\\nlooking very like a mouse just then, as she peeped out of the upper\\nberth, with her gray gown, bright eyes, and quick nod of\\ncontentment.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, I’ve just one word of advice to give you. Don’t let\\nthat child tyrannize over you. She means well, but is wilful and\\nthoughtless, and it is NOT your duty to be made a slave of. Assert\\nyourself and she will obey and respect you, and you will help her a\\ngreat deal. I know all about it; I was a companion in my youth, and\\nhad a hard time of it till I revolted and took my proper place. Now\\nlet us go up and enjoy the fine air while we can.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will remember;” and Jane offered the good lady her\\narm, with a feeling of gratitude for such friendliness, all being\\nnew and strange to her, and many doubts of her own fitness for the\\nposition lying heavy at her heart.\\n\\nBut soon all was forgotten as she sat on deck watching the islands,\\nlighthouses, ships, and shores glide by as she went swiftly out to\\nsea that bright June day. Here was the long-cherished desire of her\\nlife come to pass at last, and now the parting with mother and\\nsisters was over, nothing but pleasure remained, and a very earnest\\npurpose to improve this unexpected opportunity to the uttermost.\\nThe cares of life had begun early for little Jane, she being the\\neldest of the three girls, and her mother a widow. First came hard\\nstudy, then a timid beginning as nursery governess; and as year by\\nyear the teaching of others taught her, she ventured on till here\\nshe was companion to a fine young lady “going abroad,” where every\\nfacility for acquiring languages, studying history, seeing the best\\npictures, and enjoying good society would all be hers. No wonder the\\nquiet face under the modest gray hat beamed, as it turned wistfully\\ntoward the unknown world before her, and that her thoughts were so\\nfar away, she was quite unconscious of the kind eyes watching her,\\nas Mrs. Homer sat placidly knitting beside her.\\n\\n“I shall like the Mouse, I’m quite sure. Hope Lemuel will be as well\\nsatisfied. Ethel is charming when she chooses, but will need looking\\nafter, that’s plain,” thought the lady as she glanced down the deck\\nto where her husband stood talking with several gentlemen, while his\\ncharge was already making friends with the gay girls who were to be\\nher fellow-passengers.\\n\\n“Daisy Millers, I fear,” went on Mrs. Homer, who had a keen eye for\\ncharacter, and was as fond of studying the people about her as the\\nProfessor was of looking up dead statesmen, kings, and warriors. The\\nyoung ladies certainly bore some resemblance to the type of American\\ngirl which one never fails to meet in travelling. They were dressed\\nin the height of the fashion, pretty with the delicate evanescent\\nbeauty of too many of our girls, and all gifted with the loud\\nvoices, shrill laughter, and free-and-easy manners which so astonish\\ndecorous English matrons and maids. Ethel was evidently impressed\\nwith their style, as they had a man and maid at their beck and call,\\nand every sign of ostentatious wealth about them. A stout papa, a\\nthin mamma, evidently worn out with the cares of the past winter,\\nthree half-grown girls, and a lad of sixteen made up the party; and\\na very lively one it was, as the Professor soon found, for he\\npresently bowed himself away, and left Ethel to her new friends,\\nsince she smilingly refused to leave them.\\n\\n“Ought I to go to her?” asked Jenny, waking from her happy reverie\\nto a sudden sense of duty as the gentleman sat down beside her.\\n\\n“Oh dear, no, she is all right. Those are the Sibleys of New York.\\nHer father knows them, and she will find them a congenial refuge\\nwhen she tires of us quiet folk; and you too, perhaps?” added the\\nProfessor as he glanced at the girl.\\n\\n“I think not. I should not be welcome to them, nor are they the sort\\nof people I like. I shall be very happy with the ‘quiet folk,’ if\\nthey won’t let me be in the way,” answered Jenny, in the cheerful\\nvoice that reminded one of the chirp of a robin.\\n\\n“We won’t; we’ll toss you overboard as soon as you begin to scream\\nand bounce in that style,” he answered, laughing at the idea of this\\ndemure young person’s ever dreaming of such a thing. Jenny laughed\\nalso, and ran to pick up Mrs. Homer’s ball, as it set out for a roll\\ninto the lee-scuppers. As she brought it back she found the\\nProfessor examining the book she left behind her.\\n\\n“Like all young travellers you cling to your ‘Baedeker,’ I see, even\\nin the first excitement of the start. He is a useful fellow, but I\\nknow my Europe so well now, I don’t need him.”\\n\\n“I thought it would be wise to read up our route a little, then I\\nneedn’t ask questions. They must be very tiresome to people who know\\nall about it,” said Jenny, regarding him with an expression of deep\\nrespect for she considered him a sort of walking encyclopaedia of\\nuniversal knowledge.\\n\\nIt pleased the learned man, who was kindly as well as wise, and\\nloved to let his knowledge overflow into any thirsty mind, however\\nsmall the cup might be. He liked the intelligent face before him,\\nand a timid question or two set him off on his favorite hobby at a\\npleasant amble, with Jenny on the pillion behind, as it were. She\\nenjoyed it immensely, and was deep in French history, when the lunch\\ngong recalled her from Francis I. and his sister Margaret to chops\\nand English ale.\\n\\nEthel came prancing back to her own party, full of praises of the\\nSibleys, and the fun they meant to have together.\\n\\n“They are going to the Langham; so we shall be able to go about with\\nthem, and they know all the best shops, and some lords and ladies,\\nand expect to be in Paris when we are, and that will be a great help\\nwith our dresses and things.”\\n\\n“But we are not going to shop and have new dresses till we are on\\nour way home, you know. Now we haven’t time for such things, and\\ncan’t trouble the Homers with more trunks,” answered Jenny, as they\\nfollowed their elders to the table.\\n\\n“I shall buy what I like, and have ten trunks if it suits me. I’m\\nnot going to poke round over old books and ruins, and live in a\\ntravelling-dress all the time. You can do as you like; it’s\\ndifferent with me, and _I_ know what is proper.”\\n\\nWith which naughty speech Ethel took her seat first at the table,\\nand began to nod and smile at the Sibleys opposite. Jenny set her\\nlips and made no answer, but ate her lunch with what appetite she\\ncould, trying to forget her troubles in listening to the chat going\\non around her.\\n\\nAll that afternoon Ethel left her to herself, and enjoyed the more\\ncongenial society of the new acquaintances. Jenny was tired, and\\nglad to read and dream in the comfortable seat Mrs. Homer left her\\nwhen she went for her nap.\\n\\nBy sunset the sea grew rough and people began to vanish below. There\\nwere many empty places at dinner-time, and those who appeared seemed\\nto have lost their appetites suddenly. The Homers were good\\nsailors, but Jenny looked pale, and Ethel said her head ached,\\nthough both kept up bravely till nine o’clock, when the Sibleys\\nprecipitately retired after supper, and Ethel thought she might as\\nwell go to bed early to be ready for another pleasant day to-morrow.\\n\\nJenny had a bad night, but disturbed no one. Ethel slept soundly,\\nand sprang up in the morning, eager to be the first on deck. But a\\nsudden lurch sent her and her hair-brush into a corner: and when she\\nrose, everything in the stateroom seemed to be turning somersaults,\\nwhile a deathly faintness crept over her.\\n\\n“Oh, wake up, Jane! We are sinking! What is it? Help me, help me!”\\n and with a dismal wail Ethel tumbled into her berth in the first\\nanguish of seasickness.\\n\\nWe will draw the curtain for three days, during which rough weather\\nand general despair reigned. Mrs. Homer took care of the girls till\\nJenny was able to sit up and amuse Ethel; but the latter had a hard\\ntime of it, for a series of farewell lunches had left her in a bad\\nstate for a sea-voyage, and the poor girl could not lift her head\\nfor days. The new-made friends did not trouble themselves about her\\nafter a call of condolence, but faithful Jenny sat by her hour after\\nhour, reading and talking by day, singing her to sleep at night, and\\noften creeping from her bed on the sofa to light her little candle\\nand see that her charge was warmly covered and quite comfortable.\\nEthel was used to being petted, so she was not very grateful; but\\nshe felt the watchful care about her, and thought Jane almost as\\nhandy a person as a maid, and told her so.\\n\\nJenny thanked her and said nothing of her own discomforts; but Mrs.\\nHomer saw them, and wrote to Mrs. Amory that so far the companion\\nwas doing admirably and all that could be desired. A few days later\\nshe added more commendations to the journal-letters she kept for the\\nanxious mothers at home, and this serio-comical event was the cause\\nof her fresh praises.\\n\\nThe occupants of the deck staterooms were wakened in the middle of\\nthe night by a crash and a cry, and starting up found that the\\nengines were still, and something was evidently the matter\\nsomewhere. A momentary panic took place; ladies screamed, children\\ncried, and gentlemen in queer costumes burst out of their rooms,\\nexcitedly demanding, “What is the matter?”\\n\\nAs no lamps are allowed in the rooms at night, darkness added to the\\nalarm, and it was some time before the real state of the case was\\nknown. Mrs. Homer went at once to the frightened girls, and found\\nEthel clinging to Jenny, who was trying to find the life-preservers\\nlashed to the wall.\\n\\n“We’ve struck! Don’t leave me! Let us die together! Oh, why did I\\ncome? why did I come?” she wailed; while the other girl answered\\nwith a brave attempt at cheerfulness, as she put over Ethel’s head\\nthe only life-preserver she could find,--.\\n\\n“I will! I will! Be calm, dear! I guess there is no immediate\\ndanger. Hold fast to this while I try to find something warm for you\\nto put on.”\\n\\nIn a moment Jenny’s candle shone like a star of hope in the gloom,\\nand by the time the three had got into wrappers and shawls, a peal\\nof laughter from the Professor assured them that the danger could\\nnot be great. Other sounds of merriment, as well as Mrs. Sibley’s\\nvoice scolding violently, was heard; and presently Mr. Homer came to\\ntell them to be calm, for the stoppage was only to cool the engines,\\nand the noise was occasioned by Joe Sibley’s tumbling out of his\\nberth in a fit of nightmare caused by Welsh rarebits and poached\\neggs at eleven at night.\\n\\nMuch relieved, and a little ashamed now of their fright, every one\\nsubsided; but Ethel could not sleep, and clung to Jenny in an\\nhysterical state till a soft voice began to sing “Abide with me” so\\nsweetly that more than one agitated listener blessed the singer and\\nfell asleep before the comforting hymn ended.\\n\\nEthel was up next day, and lay on the Professor’s bearskin rug on\\ndeck, looking pale and interesting, while the Sibleys sat by her\\ntalking over the exciting event of the night, to poor Joe’s great\\ndisgust. Jenny crept to her usual corner and sat with a book on her\\nlap, quietly reviving in the fresh air till she was able to enjoy\\nthe pleasant chat of the Homers, who established themselves near by\\nand took care of her, learning each day to love and respect the\\nfaithful little soul who kept her worries to herself, and looked\\nbrightly forward no matter how black the sky might be.\\n\\nOnly one other incident of the voyage need be told; but as that\\nmarked a change in the relations between the two girls it is worth\\nrecording.\\n\\nAs she prepared for bed late one evening, Mrs. Homer heard Jenny say\\nin a tone never used before,--\\n\\n“My dear, I must say something to you or I shall not feel as if I\\nwere doing my duty. I promised your mother that you should keep\\nearly hours, as you are not very strong and excitement is bad for\\nyou. Now, you WON’T come to bed at ten, as I ask you to every night,\\nbut stay up playing cards or sitting on deck till nearly every one\\nbut the Sibleys is gone. Mrs. Homer waits for us, and is tired, and\\nit is very rude to keep her up. Will you PLEASE do as you ought, and\\nnot oblige me to say you must?”\\n\\nEthel was sleepy and cross, and answered pettishly, as she held out\\nher foot to have her boot unbuttoned,--for Jenny, anxious to please,\\nrefused no service asked of her,--\\n\\n“I shall do as I like, and you and Mrs. Homer needn’t trouble\\nyourselves about me. Mamma wished me to have a good time, and I\\nshall! There is no harm in staying up to enjoy the moonlight, and\\nsing and tell stories. Mrs. Sibley knows what is proper better than\\nyou do.”\\n\\n“I don’t think she does, for she goes to bed and leaves the girls to\\nflirt with those officers in a way that I know is NOT proper,”\\n answered Jenny, firmly. “I should be very sorry to hear them say of\\nyou as they did of the Sibley girls, ‘They are a wild lot, but great\\nfun.’”\\n\\n“Did they say that? How impertinent!” and Ethel bridled up like a\\nruffled chicken, for she was not out yet, and had not lost the\\nmodest instincts that so soon get blunted when a frivolous\\nfashionable life begins.\\n\\n“I heard them, and I know that the well-bred people on board do not\\nlike the Sibleys’ noisy ways and bad manners. Now, you, my dear, are\\nyoung and unused to this sort of life; so you cannot be too careful\\nwhat you say and do, and with whom you go.”\\n\\n“Good gracious! any one would think YOU were as wise as Solomon and\\nas old as the hills. YOU are young, and YOU haven’t travelled, and\\ndon’t know any more of the world than I do,--not so much of some\\nthings; so you needn’t preach.”\\n\\n“I’m not wise nor old, but I DO know more of the world than you, for\\nI began to take care of myself and earn my living at sixteen, and\\nfour years of hard work have taught me a great deal. I am to watch\\nover you, and I intend to do it faithfully, no matter what you say,\\nnor how hard you make it for me; because I promised, and I shall\\nkeep my word. We are not to trouble Mrs. Homer with our little\\nworries, but try to help each other and have a really good time. I\\nwill do anything for you that I can, but I shall NOT let you do\\nthings which I wouldn’t allow my own sisters to do, and if you\\nrefuse to mind me, I shall write to your mother and ask to go home.\\nMy conscience won’t let me take money and pleasure unless I earn\\nthem and do my duty.”\\n\\n“Well, upon my word!” cried Ethel, much impressed by such a decided\\nspeech from gentle Jane, and dismayed at the idea of being taken\\nhome in disgrace.\\n\\n“We won’t talk any more now, because we may get angry and say what\\nwe should be sorry for. I am sure you will see that I am right when\\nyou think it over quietly. So good-night, dear.”\\n\\n“Good-night,” was all the reply Ethel gave, and a long silence\\nfollowed.\\n\\nMrs. Homer could not help hearing as the staterooms were close\\ntogether, and the well-ventilated doors made all conversation\\nbeyond a whisper audible.\\n\\n“I didn’t think Jane had the spirit to talk like that. She has taken\\nmy hint and asserted herself, and I’m very glad, for Ethel must be\\nset right at once or we shall have no peace. She will respect and\\nobey Jane after this, or I shall be obliged to say MY word.”\\n\\nMrs. Homer was right, and before her first nap set in she heard a\\nmeek voice say,--\\n\\n“Are you asleep, Miss Bassett?”\\n\\n“No, dear.”\\n\\n“Then I want to say, I’ve thought it over. Please DON’T write to\\nmamma. I’ll be good. I’m sorry I was rude to you; do forgive--”\\n\\nThe sentence was not ended, for a sudden rustle, a little sob, and\\nseveral hearty kisses plainly told that Jenny had flown to pardon,\\ncomfort, and caress her naughty child, and that all was well.\\n\\nAfter that Ethel’s behavior was painfully decorous for the rest of\\nthe voyage, which, fortunately for her good resolutions, ended at\\nQueenstown, much to her regret. The Homers thought a glimpse at\\nIreland and Scotland would be good for the girls; and as the\\nProfessor had business in Edinburgh this was the better route for\\nall parties. But Ethel longed for London, and refused to see any\\nbeauty in the Lakes of Killarney, turned up her nose at\\njaunting-cars, and pronounced Dublin a stupid place.\\n\\nScotland suited her better, and she could not help enjoying the fine\\nscenery with such companions as the Homers; for the Professor knew\\nall about the relics and ruins, and his wife had a memory richly\\nstored with the legends, poetry, and romance which make dull facts\\nmemorable and history enchanting.\\n\\nBut Jenny’s quiet rapture was pleasant to behold. She had not\\nscorned Scott’s novels as old-fashioned, and she peopled the\\ncottages and castles with his heroes and heroines; she crooned\\nBurns’s sweet songs to herself as she visited his haunts, and went\\nabout in a happy sort of dream, with her head full of Highland Mary,\\nTam o’ Shanter, field-mice and daisies, or fought terrific battles\\nwith Fitz-James and Marmion, and tried if “the light harebell” would\\n“raise its head, elastic from her airy tread,” as it did from the\\nLady of the Lake’s famous foot.\\n\\nEthel told her she was “clean daft;” but Jenny said, “Let me enjoy\\nit while I can. I’ve dreamed of it so long I can hardly realize that\\nit has come, and I cannot lose a minute of it;” so she absorbed\\nScotch poetry and romance with the mist and the keen air from the\\nmoors, and bloomed like the bonnie heather which she loved to wear.\\n\\n“What shall we do this rainy day in this stupid place?” said Ethel,\\none morning when bad weather kept them from an excursion to Stirling\\nCastle.\\n\\n“Write our journals and read up for the visit; then we shall know\\nall about the castle, and need not tire people with our questions,”\\n answered Jenny, already established in a deep window-seat of their\\nparlor at the hotel with her books and portfolio.\\n\\n“I don’t keep a journal, and I hate to read guide-books; it’s much\\neasier to ask, though there is very little I care for about these\\nmouldy old places,” said Ethel with a yawn, as she looked out into\\nthe muddy street.\\n\\n“How can you say so? Don’t you care for poor Mary, and Prince\\nCharlie, and all the other sad and romantic memories that haunt the\\ncountry? Why, it seems as real to me as if it happened yesterday,\\nand I never can forget anything about the place or the people now.\\nReally, dear, I think you ought to take more interest and improve\\nthis fine chance. Just see how helpful and lovely Mrs. Homer is,\\nwith a quotation for every famous spot we see. It adds so much to\\nour pleasure, and makes her so interesting. I’m going to learn some\\nof the fine bits in this book of hers, and make them my own, since I\\ncannot buy the beautiful little set this Burns belongs to. Don’t you\\nwant to try it, and while away the dull day by hearing each other\\nrecite and talking over the beautiful places we have seen?”\\n\\n“No, thank you; no study for me. It is to be all play now. Why tire\\nmy wits with that Scotch stuff when Mrs. Homer is here to do it for\\nme?” and lazy Ethel turned to the papers on the table for amusement\\nmore to her taste.\\n\\n“But we shouldn’t think only of our own pleasure, you know. It is so\\nsweet to be able to teach, amuse, or help others in any way. I’m\\nglad to learn this new accomplishment, so that I may be to some one\\nby-and-by what dear Mrs. Homer is to us now, if I ever can. Didn’t\\nyou see how charmed those English people were at Holyrood when she\\nwas reciting those fine lines to us? The old gentleman bowed and\\nthanked her, and the handsome lady called her ‘a book of elegant\\nextracts.’ I thought it was such a pretty and pleasant thing that I\\ndescribed it all to mother and the girls.”\\n\\n“So it was; but did you know that the party was Lord Cumberland and\\nhis family? The guide told me afterward. I never guessed they were\\nanybody, in such plain tweed gowns and thick boots; did you?”\\n\\n“I knew they were ladies and gentlemen by their manners and\\nconversation; did you expect they would travel in coronets and\\nermine mantles?” laughed Jenny.\\n\\n“I’m not such a goose! But I’m glad we met them, because I can tell\\nthe Sibleys of it. They think so much of titles, and brag about Lady\\nWatts Barclay, whose husband is only a brewer knighted. I shall buy\\na plaid like the one the lord’s daughter wore, and wave it in the\\nfaces of those girls; they do put on SUCH airs because they have\\nbeen in Europe before.”\\n\\nJenny was soon absorbed in her books; so Ethel curled herself up in\\nthe window-seat with an illustrated London paper full of some royal\\nevent, and silence reigned for an hour. Neither had seen the\\nProfessor’s glasses rise like two full moons above his paper now and\\nthen to peep at them as they chatted at the other end of the room;\\nneither saw him smile as he made a memorandum in his note-book, nor\\nguessed how pleased he was at Jenny’s girlish admiration of his\\nplain but accomplished and excellent wife. It was one of the trifles\\nwhich went to form his opinion of the two lasses, and in time to\\nsuggest a plan which ended in great joy for one of them.\\n\\n“Now the real fun begins, and I shall be perfectly contented,” cried\\nEthel as they rolled through the London streets towards the dingy\\nLangham Hotel, where Americans love to congregate.\\n\\nJenny’s eyes were sparkling also, and she looked as if quite ready\\nfor the new scenes and excitements which the famous old city\\npromised them, though she had private doubts as to whether anything\\ncould be more delightful than Scotland.\\n\\nThe Sibleys were at the hotel; and the ladies of both parties at\\nonce began a round of shopping and sightseeing, while the gentlemen\\nwent about their more important affairs. Joe was detailed for escort\\nduty; and a fine time the poor lad had of it, trailing about with\\nseven ladies by day and packing them into two cabs at night for the\\ntheatres and concerts they insisted on trying to enjoy in spite of\\nheat and weariness.\\n\\nMrs. Homer and Jenny were soon tired of this “whirl of gayety,” as\\nthey called it, and planned more quiet excursions with some hours\\neach day for rest and the writing and reading which all wise\\ntourists make a part of their duty and pleasure. Ethel rebelled, and\\nmuch preferred the “rabble,” as Joe irreverently called his troop of\\nladies, never losing her delight in Regent Street shops, the parks\\nat the fashionable hour, and the evening shows in full blast\\neverywhere during the season. She left the sober party whenever she\\ncould escape, and with Mrs. Sibley as chaperone, frolicked about\\nwith the gay girls to her heart’s content. It troubled Jenny, and\\nmade her feel as if she were not doing her duty; but Mrs. Homer\\nconsoled her by the fact that a month was all they could give to\\nLondon, and soon the parties would separate, for the Sibleys were\\nbound for Paris, and the Professor for Switzerland and Germany,\\nthrough August and September.\\n\\nSo little Jane gave herself up to the pleasures she loved, and with\\nthe new friends, whose kindness she tried to repay by every small\\nservice in her power, spent happy days among the famous haunts they\\nknew so well, learning much and storing away all she saw and heard\\nfor future profit and pleasure. A few samples of the different ways\\nin which our young travellers improved their opportunities will\\nsufficiently illustrate this new version of the gay grasshopper and\\nthe thrifty ant.\\n\\nWhen they visited Westminster Abbey, Ethel was soon tired of tombs\\nand chapels, and declared that the startling tableau of the skeleton\\nDeath peeping out of the half-opened door of the tomb to throw his\\ndart at Mrs. Nightingale, and the ludicrous has-relief of some great\\nearl in full peer’s robes and coronet being borne to heaven in the\\narms of fat cherubs puffing under their load, were the only things\\nworth seeing.\\n\\nJenny sat spellbound in the Poets’ Corner, listening while Mrs.\\nHomer named the illustrious dead around them; followed the verger\\nfrom chapel to chapel with intelligent interest as he told the story\\nof each historical or royal tomb, and gave up Madam Tussaud’s\\nwax-work to spend several happy hours sketching the beautiful\\ncloisters in the Abbey to add to her collection of water-colors,\\ntaken as she went from place to place, to serve as studies for her\\npupils at home.\\n\\nAt the Tower she grew much excited over the tragic spots she visited\\nand the heroic tales she heard of the kings and queens, the noble\\nhearts and wise heads, that pined and perished there. Ethel “hated\\nhorrors,” she said, and cared only for the crown jewels, the faded\\neffigies in the armor gallery, and the queer Highlanders skirling on\\nthe bagpipes in the courtyard.\\n\\nAt Kew Jenny revelled in the rare flowers, and was stricken with\\namazement at the Victoria Regia, the royal water-lily, so large that\\na child could sit on one of its vast leaves as on a green island.\\nHer interest and delight so touched the heart of the crusty keeper\\nthat he gave her a nosegay of orchids, which excited the envy of\\nEthel and the Sibley girls, who were of the party, but had soon\\nwearied of plants and gone off to order tea in Flora’s Bower,--one\\nof the little cottages where visitors repose and refresh themselves\\nwith weak tea and Bath buns in such tiny rooms that they have to put\\ntheir wraps in the fireplace or out of the window while they feast.\\n\\nAt the few parties to which they went,--for the Homers’ friends were\\nof the grave, elderly sort,--Jenny sat in a corner taking notes of\\nthe gay scene, while Ethel yawned. But the Mouse got many a crumb of\\ngood conversation as she nestled close to Mrs. Homer, drinking in\\nthe wise and witty chat that went on between the friends who came to\\npay their respects to the Professor and his interesting wife. Each\\nnight Jenny had new and famous names to add to the list in her\\njournal, and the artless pages were rich in anecdotes, descriptions,\\nand comments on the day’s adventures.\\n\\nBut the gem of her London collection of experiences was found in a\\nmost unexpected way, and not only gave her great pleasure, but made\\nthe young gadabouts regard her with sudden respect as one come to\\nhonor.\\n\\n“Let me stay and wait upon you; I’d much rather than go to the\\nCrystal Palace, for I shouldn’t enjoy it at all with you lying here\\nin pain and alone,” said Jenny one lovely morning when the girls\\ncame down ready for the promised excursion, to find Mrs. Homer laid\\nup with a nervous headache.\\n\\n“No, dear, you can do nothing for me, thanks. Quiet is all I need,\\nand my only worry is that I am not able to write up my husband’s\\nnotes for him. I promised to have them ready last night, but was so\\ntired I could not do it,” answered Mrs. Homer, as Jenny leaned over\\nher full of affectionate anxiety.\\n\\n“Let me do them! I’d be so proud to help; and I can, for I did copy\\nsome one day, and he said it was well done. Please let me; I should\\nenjoy a quiet morning here much better than the noisy party we shall\\nhave, since the Sibleys are to go.”\\n\\nWith some reluctance the invalid consented; and when the rest were\\ngone with hasty regrets, Jenny fell to work so briskly that in an\\nhour or two the task was done. She was looking wistfully out of the\\nwindow wondering where she could go alone, since Mrs. Homer was\\nasleep and no one needed her, when the Professor came in to see how\\nhis wife was before he went to the British Museum to consult certain\\nfamous books and parchments.\\n\\nHe was much pleased to find his notes in order, and after a glance\\nat the sleeping lady, told Jenny she was to come with him for a\\nvisit to a place which SHE would enjoy, though most young people\\nthought it rather dull.\\n\\nAway they went; and being given in charge to a pleasant old man,\\nJenny roamed over the vast Museum where the wonders of the world are\\ncollected, enjoying every moment, till Mr. Homer called her away, as\\nhis day’s work was done. It was late now, but she never thought of\\ntime, and came smiling up from the Egyptian Hall ready for the lunch\\nthe Professor proposed. They were just going out when a gentleman\\nmet them, and recognizing the American stopped to greet him\\ncordially. Jenny’s heart beat when she was presented to Mr.\\nGladstone, and she listened with all her ears to the silvery\\nun-English voice, and stared with all her eyes at the weary yet wise\\nand friendly face of the famous man.\\n\\n“I’m so glad! I wanted to see him very much, and I feel so grand to\\nthink I’ve really had a bow and a smile all to myself from the\\nPremier of England,” said Jenny in a flutter of girlish delight when\\nthe brief interview was over.\\n\\n“You shall go to the House of Commons with me and hear him speak\\nsome day; then your cup will be full, since you have already seen\\nBrowning, heard Irving, taken tea with Jean Ingelow, and caught a\\nglimpse of the royal family,” said the Professor, enjoying her keen\\ninterest in people and places.\\n\\n“Oh, thanks! that will be splendid. I do love to see famous persons,\\nbecause it gives me a true picture of them, and adds to my desire to\\nknow more of them, and admire their virtues or shun their faults.”\\n\\n“Yes, that sort of mental picture-gallery is a good thing to have,\\nand we will add as many fine portraits as we can. Now you shall ride\\nin a Hansom, and see how you like that.”\\n\\nJenny was glad to do so, for ladies do not use these vehicles when\\nalone, and Ethel had put on great airs after a spin in one with Joe.\\nJenny was girl enough to like to have her little adventures to boast\\nof, and that day she was to have another which eclipsed all that her\\nyoung companions ever knew.\\n\\nA brisk drive, a cosy lunch at a famous chop-house where Johnson\\nhad drunk oceans of tea, was followed by a stroll in the Park; for\\nthe Professor liked his young comrade, and was grateful for the\\nwell-written notes which helped on his work.\\n\\nAs they leaned against the railing to watch the splendid equipages\\nroll by, one that seemed well known, though only conspicuous by its\\nquiet elegance, stopped near them, and the elder of the two ladies\\nin it bowed and beckoned to Professor Homer. He hastened forward to\\nbe kindly greeted and invited to drive along the Ladies’ Mile.\\nJenny’s breath was nearly taken away when she was presented to the\\nDuchess of S--, and found herself sitting in a luxurious carriage\\nopposite her Grace and her companion, with a white-wigged coachman\\nperched aloft and two powdered footmen erect behind. Secretly\\nrejoicing that she had made herself especially nice for her trip\\nwith the Professor, and remembering that young English girls are\\nexpected to efface themselves in the company of their elders, she\\nsat mute and modest, stealing shy glances from under her hat-brim at\\nthe great lady, who was talking in the simplest way with her guest\\nabout his work, in which, as a member of one of the historical\\nhouses of England, she took much interest. A few gracious words fell\\nto Jenny’s share before they were set down at the door of the hotel,\\nto the great admiration of the porter, who recognized the liveries\\nand spread the news.\\n\\n“This is a good sample of the way things go in Vanity Fair. We\\ntrudge away to our daily work afoot, we treat ourselves to a humble\\ncab through the mud, pause in the park to watch the rich and great,\\nget whisked into a ducal carriage, and come home in state, feeling\\nrather exalted, don’t we?” asked the Professor as they went\\nupstairs, and he observed the new air of dignity which Jane\\nunconsciously assumed as an obsequious waiter flew before to open\\nthe door.\\n\\n“I think we do,” answered honest Jane, laughing as she caught the\\ntwinkle of his eyes behind the spectacles. “I like splendor, and I\\nAM rather set up to think I’ve spoken to a live duchess; but I think\\nI like her beautiful old face and charming manners more than her\\nfine coach or great name. Why, she was much more simply dressed than\\nMrs. Sibley, and talked as pleasantly as if she did not feel a bit\\nabove us. Yet one couldn’t forget that she was noble, and lived in a\\nvery different world from ours.”\\n\\n“That is just it, my dear; she IS a noble woman in every sense of\\nthe word, and has a right to her title. Her ancestors were\\nkingmakers, and she is Lady-in-waiting to the Queen; yet she leads\\nthe charities of London, and is the friend of all who help the world\\nalong. I’m glad you have met her, and seen so good a sample of a\\ntrue aristocrat. We Americans affect to scorn titles, but too many\\nof us hanker for them in secret, and bow before very poor imitations\\nof the real thing. Don’t fill your journal with fine names, as some\\nmuch wiser folk do, but set down only the best, and remember, ‘All\\nthat glitters is not gold.’”\\n\\n“I will, sir.” And Jenny put away the little sermon side by side\\nwith the little adventure, saying nothing of either till Mrs. Homer\\nspoke of it, having heard the story from her husband.\\n\\n“How I wish I’d been there, instead of fagging round that great\\npalace full of rubbish! A real Duchess! Won’t the Sibleys stare? We\\nshall hear no more of Lady Watts Barclay after this, I guess, and\\nyou will be treated with great respect; see if you are not!” said\\nEthel, much impressed with her companion’s good fortune and eager to\\ntell it.\\n\\n“If things of that sort affect them, their respect is not worth\\nhaving,” answered Jane, quietly accepting the arm Ethel offered her\\nas they went to dinner,--a very unusual courtesy, the cause of which\\nshe understood and smiled at.\\n\\nEthel looked as if she felt the reproof, but said nothing, only set\\nan example of greater civility to her companion, which the other\\ngirls involuntarily followed, after they had heard of Jenny’s\\nexcursion with the Professor.\\n\\nThe change was very grateful to patient Jane, who had borne many\\nsmall slights in proud silence; but it was soon over, for the\\nparties separated, and our friends left the city far behind them, as\\nthey crossed the channel, and sailed up the Rhine to Schwalbach,\\nwhere Mrs. Homer was to try the steel springs for her rheumatism\\nwhile the Professor rested after his London labors.\\n\\nA charming journey, and several very happy weeks followed as the\\ngirls roamed about the Little Brunnen, gay with people from all\\nparts of Europe, come to try the famous mineral waters, and rest\\nunder the lindens.\\n\\nJenny found plenty to sketch here, and was busy all day booking\\npicturesque groups as they sat in the Allee Saal, doing pretty\\nwoodland bits as they strolled among the hills, carefully copying\\nthe arches and statues in St. Elizabeth’s Chapel, or the queer old\\nhouses in the Jews’ Quarter of the town. Even the pigs went into the\\nportfolio, with the little swineherd blowing his horn in the morning\\nto summon each lazy porker from its sty to join the troop that\\ntrotted away to eat acorns in the oak wood on the hill till sunset\\ncalled them home again.\\n\\nEthel’s chief amusement was buying trinkets at the booths near the\\nStahlbrunnen. A tempting display of pretty crystal, agate, and steel\\njewelry was there, with French bonbons, Swiss carvings, German\\nembroidery and lace-work, and most delectable little portfolios of\\nviews of fine scenery or illustrations of famous books. Ethel spent\\nmuch money here, and added so greatly to her store of souvenirs that\\na new trunk was needed to hold the brittle treasures she accumulated\\nin spite of the advice given her to wait till she reached Paris,\\nwhere all could be bought much cheaper and packed safely for\\ntransportation.\\n\\nJenny contented herself with a German book, Kaulbach’s Goethe\\nGallery, and a set of ornaments for each sister; the purple, pink,\\nand white crystals being cheap and pretty trinkets for young girls.\\nShe felt very rich with her generous salary to draw upon when she\\nliked; but having made a list of proper gifts, she resisted\\ntemptation and saved her money, remembering how much every penny was\\nneeded at home.\\n\\nDriving from the ruins of Hohenstein one lovely afternoon, the girls\\ngot out to walk up a long hill, and amused themselves gathering\\nflowers by the way. When they took their places again, Ethel had a\\ngreat bouquet of scarlet poppies, Jenny a nosegay of blue\\ncorn-flowers for Mrs. Homer, and a handful of green wheat for\\nherself.\\n\\n“You look as if you had been gleaning,” said the Professor, as he\\nwatched the girls begin to trim their rough straw hats with the gay\\ncoquelicots and the bearded ears.\\n\\n“I feel as if I were doing that every day, sir, and gathering in a\\ngreat harvest of pleasure, if nothing else,” answered Jenny, turning\\nher bright eyes full of gratitude from one kind face to the other.\\n\\n“My poppies are much prettier than that stiff stuff. Why didn’t you\\nget some?” asked Ethel, surveying her brilliant decoration with\\ngreat satisfaction.\\n\\n“They don’t last; but my wheat will, and only grow prettier as it\\nripens in my hat,” answered Jenny, contentedly settling the graceful\\nspires in the straw cord that bound the pointed crown.\\n\\n“Then the kernels will all drop out and leave the husks; that won’t\\nbe nice, I’m sure,” laughed Ethel.\\n\\n“Well, some hungry bird will pick them up and be glad of them. The\\nhusks will last a long time and remind me of this happy day; your\\npoppies are shedding their leaves already, and the odor is not\\npleasant. I like my honest breadmaking wheat better than your opium\\nflowers,” said Jenny, with her thoughtful smile, as she watched the\\nscarlet petals float away leaving the green seed-vessels bare.\\n\\n“Oh, I shall get some artificial ones at my little milliner’s, and\\nbe fine as long as I like; so you are welcome to your useful,\\nbristly old wheat,” said Ethel, rather nettled by the look that\\npassed between the elders.\\n\\nNothing more was said; but both girls remembered that little talk\\nlong afterward, for those two wayside nosegays served to point the\\nmoral of this little tale, if not to adorn it.\\n\\nWe have no space to tell all the pleasant wanderings of our\\ntravellers as they went from one interesting place to another, till\\nthey paused for a good rest at Geneva.\\n\\nHere Ethel quite lost her head among the glittering display of\\njewelry, and had to be watched lest she rashly spend her last penny.\\nThey were obliged almost forcibly to carry her out of the enchanting\\nshops; and no one felt safe till she was either on the lake, or\\ndriving to Chamouni, or asleep in her bed.\\n\\nJenny bought a watch, a very necessary thing for a teacher, and this\\nwas the best place to get a good one. It was chosen with care and\\nmuch serious consultation with the Professor; and Mrs. Homer added a\\nlittle chain and seal, finding Jenny about to content herself with a\\nblack cord.\\n\\n“It is only a return for many daughterly services, my dear; and my\\nhusband wishes me to offer these with thanks to the patient\\nsecretary who has often helped him so willingly,” she said, as she\\ncame to wake Jenny with a kiss on the morning of her twenty-first\\nbirthday.\\n\\nA set of little volumes like those she had admired was the second\\ngift, and Jenny was much touched to be so kindly remembered. Ethel\\ngave her some thread lace which she had longed to buy for her mother\\nat Brussels, but did not, finding it as costly as beautiful. It was\\na very happy day, though quietly spent sitting by the lake enjoying\\nthe well-chosen extracts from Shakspeare, Wordsworth, Byron, Burns,\\nScott, and other descriptive poets, and writing loving letters home,\\nproudly stamped with the little seal.\\n\\nAfter that, while Ethel haunted the brilliant shops, read novels in\\nthe hotel-garden, or listlessly followed the sight-seers, Jenny,\\nwith the help of her valuable little library, her industrious\\npencil, and her accomplished guides, laid up a store of precious\\nsouvenirs as they visited the celebrated spots that lie like a\\nnecklace of pearls around the lovely lake, with Mont Blanc as the\\nsplendid opal that fitly clasps the chain. Calvin and Geneva,\\nVoltaire and Ferney, De Stael and Coppet, Gibbon’s garden at\\nLausanne, Byron’s Prisoner at Chillon, Rousseau’s chestnut grove at\\nClarens, and all the legends, relics, and memories of Switzerland’s\\nheroes, romancers, poets, and philosophers, were carefully studied,\\nrecorded, and enjoyed; and when at last they steamed away toward\\nParis, Jenny felt as if her head and her heart and one little trunk\\nheld richer treasures than all the jewelry in Geneva.\\n\\nAt Lyons her second important purchase was made; for when they\\nvisited one of the great manufactories to execute several\\ncommissions given to Mrs. Homer, Jenny proudly bought a nice black\\nsilk for her mother. This, with the delicate lace, would make the\\ndear woman presentable for many a day, and the good girl beamed with\\nsatisfaction as she pictured the delight of all at home when this\\nsplendid gift appeared to adorn the dear parent-bird, who never\\ncared how shabby she was if her young were well feathered.\\n\\nIt was a trial to Jenny, when they reached Paris, to spend day after\\nday shopping, talking to dressmakers, and driving in the Bois to\\nwatch the elegant world on parade, when she longed to be living\\nthrough the French Revolution with Carlyle, copying the quaint\\nrelics at Hotel Cluny, or revelling in the treasures of the Louvre.\\n\\n“Why DO you want to study and poke all the time?” asked Ethel, as\\nthey followed Mrs. Homer and a French acquaintance round the Palais\\nRoyal one day with its brilliant shops, cafes, and crowds.\\n\\n“My dream is to be able to take a place as teacher of German and\\nhistory in a girl’s school next year. It is a fine chance, and I am\\npromised it if I am fitted; so I must work when I can to be ready.\\nThat is why I like Versailles better than Rue de Rivoli, and enjoy\\ntalking with Professor Homer about French kings and queens more than\\nI do buying mock diamonds and eating ices here,” answered Jenny,\\nlooking very tired of the glitter, noise, and dust of the gay place\\nwhen her heart was in the Conciergerie with poor Marie Antoinette,\\nor the Invalides, where lay the great Napoleon still guarded by his\\nfaithful Frenchmen.\\n\\n“What a dismal prospect! I should think you’d rather have a jolly\\ntime while you could, and trust to luck for a place by-and-by, if\\nyou must go on teaching,” said Ethel, stopping to admire a window\\nfull of distracting bonnets.\\n\\n“No; it is a charming prospect to me, for I love to teach, and I\\ncan’t leave anything to luck. God helps those who help themselves,\\nmother says, and I want to give the girls an easier time than I have\\nhad; so I shall get my tools ready, and fit myself to do good work\\nwhen the job comes to me,” answered Jenny, with such a decided air\\nthat the French lady glanced back at her, wondering if a quarrel was\\ngoing on between the demoiselles.\\n\\n“What do you mean by tools?” asked Ethel, turning from the gay\\nbonnets to a ravishing display of bonbons in the next window.\\n\\n“Professor Homer said one day that a well-stored mind was a\\ntool-chest with which one could carve one’s way. Now, my tools are\\nknowledge, memory, taste, the power of imparting what I know, good\\nmanners, sense, and--patience,” added Jenny, with a sigh, as she\\nthought of the weary years spent in teaching little children the\\nalphabet.\\n\\nEthel took the sigh to herself, well knowing that she had been a\\ntrial, especially of late, when she had insisted on Jane’s company\\nbecause her own French was so imperfect as to be nearly useless,\\nthough at home she had flattered herself that she knew a good deal.\\nHer own ignorance of many things had been unpleasantly impressed\\nupon her lately, for at Madame Dene’s Pension there were several\\nagreeable English and French ladies, and much interesting\\nconversation went on at the table, which Jenny heartily enjoyed,\\nthough she modestly said very little. But Ethel, longing to\\ndistinguish herself before the quiet English girls, tried to talk\\nand often made sad mistakes because her head was a jumble of new\\nnames and places, and her knowledge of all kinds very superficial.\\nOnly the day before she had said in a patronizing tone to a French\\nlady,--\\n\\n“Of course we remember our obligations to your Lamartine during our\\nRevolution, and the other brave Frenchmen who helped us.”\\n\\n“You mean Lafayette, dear,” whispered Jenny quickly, as the lady\\nsmiled and bowed bewildered by the queerly pronounced French, but\\ncatching the poet’s name.\\n\\n“I know what I mean; you needn’t trouble yourself to correct and\\ninterrupt me when I’m talking,” answered Ethel, in her pert way,\\nannoyed by a smile on the face of the girl opposite, and Jenny’s\\nblush at her rudeness and ingratitude. She regretted both when Jane\\nexplained the matter afterward, and wished that she had at once\\ncorrected what would then have passed as a slip of the tongue. Now\\nit was too late; but she kept quiet and gave Miss Cholmondeley no\\nmore chances to smile in that aggravatingly superior way, though it\\nwas very natural, as she was a highly educated girl.\\n\\nThinking of this, and many other mistakes of her own from which Jane\\ntried to save her, Ethel felt a real remorse, and walked silently\\non, wondering how she could reward this kind creature who had served\\nher so well and was so anxious to get on in her hard, humble way.\\nThe orders were all given now, the shopping nearly done, and\\nMademoiselle Campan, the elderly French lady who boarded at their\\nPension, was always ready to jaunt about and be useful; so why not\\ngive Jane a holiday, and let her grub and study for the little while\\nleft them in Paris? In a fortnight Uncle Sam was to pick up the\\ngirls and take them home, while the Homers went to Rome for the\\nwinter. It would be well to take Miss Bassett back in a good humor,\\nso that her report would please Mamma, and appease Papa if he were\\nangry at the amount of money spent by his extravagant little\\ndaughter. Ethel saw now, as one always does when it is too late to\\nrepair damages, many things left undone which she ought to have\\ndone, and regretted living for herself instead of putting more\\npleasure into the life of this good girl, whose future seemed so\\nuninviting to our young lady with her first season very near.\\n\\nIt was a kind plan, and gratified Jenny very much when it was\\nproposed and proved to her that no duty would be neglected if she\\nwent about with the Homers and left her charge to the excellent lady\\nwho enjoyed chiffons as much as Ethel did, and was glad to receive\\npretty gifts in return for her services.\\n\\nBut alas for Ethel’s good resolutions and Jenny’s well-earned\\nholiday! Both came to nothing, for Ethel fell ill from too much\\npastry, and had a sharp bilious attack which laid her up till the\\nuncle arrived.\\n\\nEvery one was very kind, and there was no danger; but the days were\\nlong, the invalid very fretful, and the nurse very tired, before the\\nsecond week brought convalescence and a general cheering and\\nclearing up took place. Uncle Sam was amusing himself very\\ncomfortably while he waited for his niece to be able to travel, and\\nthe girls were beginning to pack by degrees, for the accumulation of\\nEthel’s purchases made her share a serious task.\\n\\n“There! All are in now, and only the steamer trunk is left to pack\\nat the last moment,” said Jenny, folding her tired arms after a\\nprotracted struggle with half a dozen new gowns, and a perplexing\\nmedley of hats, boots, gloves, and perfumery. Two large trunks stood\\nin the ante-room ready to go; the third was now done, and nothing\\nremained but the small one and Jenny’s shabby portmanteau.\\n\\n“How nicely you have managed! I ought to have helped, only you\\nwouldn’t let me and I should have spoilt my wrapper. Come and rest\\nand help me sort out this rubbish,” said Ethel, who would have been\\ndressed and out if the arrival of a new peignoir had not kept her in\\nto enjoy the lovely pink and blue thing, all lace and ribbon and\\nFrench taste.\\n\\n“You will never get them into that box, dear,” answered Jenny,\\ngladly sitting down beside her on the sofa, which was strewn with\\ntrinkets of all sorts, more or less damaged by careless handling,\\nand the vicissitudes of a wandering trunk.\\n\\n“I don’t believe they are worth fussing over. I’m tired of them, and\\nthey look very mean and silly after seeing real jewels here. I’d\\nthrow them away if I hadn’t spent so much money on them,” said\\nEthel, turning over the tarnished filigree, mock pearl, and\\nimitation coral necklaces, bracelets, and brooches that were\\ntumbling out of the frail boxes in which they came.\\n\\n“They will look pretty to people at home who have not been seeing so\\nmany as we have. I’ll sew up the broken cases, and rub up the\\nsilver, and string the beads, and make all as good as new, and you\\nwill find plenty of girls at home glad to get them, I am sure,”\\n answered Jenny, rapidly bringing order out of chaos with those\\nskilful hands of hers.\\n\\nEthel leaned back and watched her silently for a few minutes. During\\nthis last week our young lady had been thinking a good deal, and was\\nconscious of a strong desire to tell Jane Bassett how much she loved\\nand thanked her for all her patient and faithful care during the six\\nmonths now nearly over. But she was proud, and humility was hard to\\nlearn; self-will was sweet, and to own one’s self in the wrong a\\nmost distasteful task. The penitent did not know how to begin, so\\nwaited for an opportunity, and presently it came.\\n\\n“Shall you be glad to get home, Jenny?” she asked in her most\\ncaressing tone, as she hung her prettiest locket round her friend’s\\nneck; for during this illness all formality and coolness had melted\\naway, and “Miss Bassett” was “Jenny dear” now.\\n\\n“I shall be very, very glad to see my precious people again, and\\ntell them all about my splendid holiday; but I can’t help wishing\\nthat we were to stay till spring, now that we are here, and I have\\nno teaching, and may never get such another chance. I’m afraid it\\nseems ungrateful when I’ve had so much; but to go back without\\nseeing Rome is a trial, I confess,” answered honest Jane, rubbing\\naway at a very dull paste bandeau.\\n\\n“So it is; but I don’t mind so much, because I shall come again\\nby-and-by, and I mean to be better prepared to enjoy things properly\\nthan I am now. I’ll really study this winter, and not be such a\\nfool. Jenny, I’ve a plan in my head. I wonder if you’d like it? I\\nshould immensely, and I’m going to propose it to Mamma the minute I\\nget home,” said Ethel, glad to seize this opening.\\n\\n“What is it, deary?”\\n\\n“Would you like to be my governess and teach me all you know,\\nquietly, at home this winter? I don’t want to begin school again\\njust for languages and a few finishing things, and I really think\\nyou would do more for me than any one else, because you know what I\\nneed, and are so patient with your bad, ungrateful, saucy girl.\\nCould you? would you come?” and Ethel put her arms round Jenny’s\\nneck with a little sob and a kiss that was far more precious to Jane\\nthan the famous diamond necklace of Marie Antoinette, which she had\\nbeen reading about.\\n\\n“I could and I would with all my heart, if you want me, darling! I\\nthink we know and love each other now, and can be happy and helpful\\ntogether, and I’ll come so gladly if your mother asks me,” answered\\nJenny, quick to understand what underlay this sudden tenderness, and\\nglad to accept the atonement offered her for many trials which she\\nwould never have told even to her own mother.\\n\\nEthel was her best self now, and her friend felt well rewarded for\\nthe past by this promise of real love and mutual help in the future.\\nSo they talked over the new plan in great spirits till Mrs. Homer\\ncame to bring them their share of a packet of home letters just\\narrived. She saw that something unusual was going on, but only\\nsmiled, nodded, and went away saying,--\\n\\n“I have good news in MY letters, and hope yours will make you\\nequally happy, girls.”\\n\\nSilence reigned for a time, as they sat reading busily; then a\\nsudden exclamation from Ethel seemed to produce a strange effect\\nupon Jenny, for with a cry of joy she sprang up and danced all over\\nthe room, waving her letter wildly as she cried out,--\\n\\n“I’m to go! I’m to go! I can’t believe it--but here it is! How\\nkind, how very kind, every one is to me!” and down she went upon her\\nown little bed to hide her face and laugh and cry till Ethel ran to\\nrejoice with her.\\n\\n“Oh, Jenny, I’m so glad! You deserve it, and it’s like Mrs. Homer to\\nmake all smooth before she said a word. Let me read what Mamma\\nwrites to you. Here’s my letter; see how sweetly she speaks of you,\\nand how grateful they are for all you’ve done for me.”\\n\\nThe letters changed hands; and sitting side by side in an\\naffectionate bunch, the girls read the happy news that granted the\\ncherished wish of one and gave the other real unselfish pleasure in\\nanother’s happiness.\\n\\nJane was to go to Rome with the Homers for the winter, and perhaps\\nto Greece in the spring. A year of delight lay before her, offered\\nin such a friendly way, and with such words of commendation, thanks,\\nand welcome, that the girl’s heart was full, and she felt that every\\nsmall sacrifice of feeling, every lonely hour, and distasteful duty\\nwas richly repaid by this rare opportunity to enjoy still further\\ndraughts of the wisdom, beauty, and poetry of the wonderful world\\nnow open to her.\\n\\nShe flew off presently to try to thank her good friends, and came\\nback dragging a light new trunk, in which she nearly buried her\\nsmall self as she excitedly explained its appearance, while rattling\\nout the trays and displaying its many conveniences.\\n\\n“That dear woman says I’m to send my presents home in the old one by\\nyou, and take this to fill up in Rome. Think of it! A lovely new\\nFrench trunk, and Rome full of pictures, statues, St. Peter’s, and\\nthe Colosseum. It takes my breath away and makes my head spin.”\\n\\n“So I see. It’s a capital box, but it won’t hold even St. Peter’s,\\ndear; so you’d better calm down and pack your treasures. I’ll help,”\\n cried Ethel, sweeping about in her gay gown, almost as wild as Jane,\\nwho was quite upset by this sudden delicious change in her\\nprospects.\\n\\nHow happily she laid away in the old trunk the few gifts she had\\nventured to buy, and those given her,--the glossy silk, the dainty\\nlace, the pretty crystals, the store of gloves, the flask of\\ncologne, the pictures and books, and last of all the sketches which\\nillustrated the journal kept so carefully for those at home.\\n\\n“Now, when my letter is written and the check with all that is left\\nof my salary put in, I am done. There’s room for more, and I wish\\nI’d got something else, now I feel so rich. But it is foolish to buy\\ngowns to pay duties on, when I don’t know what the girls need. I\\nfeel so rich now, I shall fly out and pick up some more little\\npretties for the dears. They have so few, anything will be charming\\nto them,” said Jenny, proudly surveying her box, and looking about\\nfor some foreign trifle with which to fill up the corners.\\n\\n“Then let me put these in, and so be rid of them. I shall go to see\\nyour people and tell them all about you, and explain how you came to\\nsend so much rubbish.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ethel slipped in several Swiss carvings, the best of\\nthe trinkets, and a parcel of dainty Parisian ties and sashes which\\nwould gladden the hearts of the poor, pretty girls, just beginning\\nto need such aids to their modest toilets. A big box of bonbons\\ncompleted her contribution, and left but one empty corner.\\n\\n“I’ll tuck in my old hat to keep all steady; the girls will like it\\nwhen they dress up, and I’m fond of it, because it recalls some of\\nmy happiest days,” said Jenny, as she took up the well-worn hat and\\nbegan to dust it. A shower of grain dropped into her hand, for the\\nyellow wheat still kept its place and recalled the chat at\\nSchwalbach. Ethel glanced at her own hat with its faded artificial\\nflowers; and as her eye went from the small store of treasures so\\ncarefully and happily gathered to the strew of almost useless finery\\non her bed, she said soberly,--\\n\\n“You were right, Jenny. My poppies are worthless, and my harvest a\\nvery poor one. Your wheat fell in good ground, and you will glean a\\nwhole stack before you go home. Well, I shall keep MY old hat to\\nremind me of you: and when I come again, I hope I shall have a wiser\\nhead to put into a new one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITTLE BUTTON-ROSE\\n\\n\\n“If you please, I’ve come,” said a small girl, as she walked into a\\nlarge room where three ladies sat at work.\\n\\nOne of the ladies was very thin, one very stout, and the youngest\\nvery pretty. The eldest put on her glasses, the stout one dropped\\nher sewing, and the pretty one exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Why, it must be little Rosamond!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve come; the man is taking my trunk upstairs, and I’ve got a\\nletter for Cousin Penelope,” said the child, with the sweet\\ncomposure of one always sure of a welcome.\\n\\nThe stout lady held out her hand for the letter; but the little\\ngirl, after a keen look at the three faces, went to the old lady,\\nwho received her with a kiss, saying,--\\n\\n“That’s right; but how did you know, dear?”\\n\\n“Oh, Papa said Cousin Penny is old, Cousin Henny fat, and Cousin\\nCicely rather pretty; so I knew in one minute,” replied Rosamond, in\\na tone of innocent satisfaction at her own cleverness, and quite\\nunconscious of the effect of her speech.\\n\\nMiss Penelope hastily retired behind the letter. Miss Henrietta\\nfrowned so heavily that the gold-rimmed eye-glasses flew off her\\nnose with a clash, and Cicely laughed outright, as she exclaimed,--\\n\\n“I’m afraid we have got an enfant terrible among us, though I can’t\\ncomplain of my share of the compliments.”\\n\\n“I never expected to find Clara’s child well mannered, and I see I\\nwas quite right. Take your hat off, Rosamond, and sit down. It tires\\nSister to lean on her in that way,” said Miss Henny in a severe\\ntone, with no offer of any warmer welcome.\\n\\nSeeing that something was amiss, the child quietly obeyed, and\\nperching herself in an ancient arm-chair crossed her short legs,\\nfolded her plump hands over the diminutive travelling-bag she\\ncarried, and sat looking about the room with a pair of very large\\nblue eyes, quite unabashed, though rather pensive, as if the memory\\nof some tender parting were still fresh in her little heart.\\n\\nWhile Miss Penny slowly reads the letter, Miss Henny works daisies\\non a bit of canvas with pettish jerks of her silk, and Miss Cicely\\nleans in the sofa-corner, staring at the newcomer, we will briefly\\nintroduce our small heroine. Her father was cousin to the elder\\nladies, and being called suddenly across the water on business, took\\nhis wife with him, leaving the little girl to the care of these\\nrelatives, thinking her too young for so long a journey. Cicely, an\\norphan niece who lived with the old ladies, was to have the care of\\nRosy; and a summer in the quiet country town would do her good,\\nwhile change of scene would console her for this first separation\\nfrom her mother. How she fared remains to be seen; and we need only\\nadd that the child had been well trained, made the companion of a\\nsweet and tender woman, and was very anxious to please the parents\\nwhom she passionately loved, by keeping the promises she had made\\nthem, and being “as brave as Papa, as patient and kind as dear\\nMamma.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think of it, Missy?” asked Cicely, as the blue\\neyes came back to her, after roving round the spacious,\\nold-fashioned, and rather gloomy room.\\n\\n“It’s a pretty large, dark place for a little girl to be all alone\\nin;” and there was a suspicious quiver in the childish voice, as\\nRosy opened her bag to produce a very small handkerchief, evidently\\nfeeling that she might have sudden need of it if some one did not\\nspeak to her very soon.\\n\\n“We keep it dark on account of Sister’s eyes. When _I_ was a little\\ngirl, it wasn’t considered polite to say rude things about other\\npeople’s houses, especially if they were very handsome ones,” said\\nMiss Henny, with a stern glance over the eye-glasses at the young\\noffender, whose second remark was even more unfortunate than her\\nfirst.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be rude, but I MUST tell the truth. Little girls\\nlike bright places. I’m sorry about Cousin Penny’s eyes. I will read\\nto her; I do to Mamma, and she says it is very well for a child only\\neight years old.”\\n\\nThe gentle answer and the full eyes seemed to calm Miss Henny’s\\nwrath, for her size was her tender point, and the old house her\\nespecial pride; so she dropped the awe-inspiring glasses, and said\\nmore kindly,--\\n\\n“There is a nice little room ready for you upstairs, and a garden to\\nplay in. Cicely will hear you read every day, and I will teach you\\nto sew, for of course that MOST useful part of your education has\\nbeen neglected.”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, I sew my four patches every day, and make little wee\\nstitches, and I can hem Papa’s hank’chifs, and I was learning to\\ndarn his socks with a big needle when--when they went away.”\\n\\nRosy paused with a sudden choke; but too proud to break down, she\\nonly wiped two drops off her cheek with the long ends of her little\\ngray silk glove, set her lips, and remained mistress of herself,\\nprivately planning to cry all she liked when she was safely in the\\n“nice little room” promised her.\\n\\nCicely, though a lazy, selfish young lady, was touched by the\\nchild’s pathetic face, and said in a friendly tone, as she patted\\nthe couch where she lay,--\\n\\n“Come here, dear, and sit by me, and tell me what kind of a kitten\\nyou’d like best. I know of a sweet yellow one, and two grays. Our\\nTabby is too old to play with you; so you will want a kitty, I’m\\nsure.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, if I may!” and Rosy skipped to the new seat with a smile\\nwhich plainly proved that this sort of welcome was just what she\\nliked.\\n\\n“Now, Cicely, why will you put such an idea into Rosamond’s head\\nwhen you know we can’t have kittens round the house for Sister to\\nstumble over, not to mention the mischief the horrid things always\\ndo? Tabby is all the child needs, with her doll. Of course you have\\na doll?” and Miss Henny asked the question as solemnly as if she had\\nsaid, “Have you a soul?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I have nine in my trunk, and two little ones in my bag, and\\nMamma is going to send me a big, big one from London, as soon as she\\ngets there, to sleep with me and be my little comfort,” cried Rosy,\\nrapidly producing from her bag a tiny bride and groom, three\\nseed-cakes, a smelling-bottle, and a purse out of which fell a shower of\\nbright cents, also crumbs all over the immaculate carpet.\\n\\n“Mercy on us, what a mess! Pick it all up, child, and don’t unpack\\nany more in the parlor. One doll is quite enough for me,” said Miss\\nHenny, with a sigh of resignation as if asking patience to bear this\\nnew calamity.\\n\\nRosy echoed the sigh as she crept about reclaiming her precious\\npennies, and eating the crumbs as the only way of disposing of them.\\n\\n“Never mind, it’s only her way; the heat makes her a little cross,\\nyou see,” whispered Cicely, bending down to hold the bag, into which\\nRosy bundled her treasures in hot haste.\\n\\n“I thought fat people were always pleasant. I’m glad YOU ain’t fat,”\\n answered the little girl, in a tone which was perfectly audible.\\n\\nWhat would have happened I tremble to think, if Miss Penny had not\\nfinished the letter at that moment and handed it to her sister,\\nsaying as she held out her arms to the child,--\\n\\n“Now I know all about it, and you are to be my baby; so come and\\ngive me some sweet kisses, darling.”\\n\\nDown dropped the bag, and with a little sob of joy the child nestled\\nclose to the kind old heart that welcomed her so tenderly at last.\\n\\n“Papa calls me his button-rose, ‘cause I’m so small and pink and\\nsweet, and thorny too sometimes,” she said, looking up brightly,\\nafter a few moments of the fond and foolish cuddling all little\\ncreatures love and need so much when they leave the nest, and miss\\nthe brooding of motherly wings.\\n\\n“We’ll call you anything you like, darling; but Rosamond is a pretty\\nold name, and I’m fond of it, for it was your grandmamma’s, and a\\nsweeter woman never lived,” said Miss Penny, stroking the fresh\\ncheeks, where the tears shone like dew on pink rose-leaves.\\n\\n“I shall call you Chicken Little, because we have Henny and Penny;\\nand the girls and Tab downstairs can be Goosey-Loosey, Turkey-Lurkey,\\nand Cocky-Locky. I’ll be Ducky-Lucky, and I’m sure Foxy-Loxy lives\\nnext door,” said Cicely, laughing at her own wit, while Miss Henny\\nlooked up, saying, with the first smile Rosy had seen,--\\n\\n“That’s true enough! and I hope Chicken Little will keep out of his\\nway, no matter if the sky does fall.”\\n\\n“Who is it? A truly fox? I never saw one. Could I peep at him\\nsometimes?” cried the child, much interested at once.\\n\\n“No, dear; it’s only a neighbor of ours who has treated us badly, at\\nleast we think so, and we don’t speak, though we used to be good\\nfriends some years ago. It’s sad to live so, but we don’t quite see\\nhow to help it yet. We are ready to do our part; but Mr. Dover\\nshould take the first step, as he was in the wrong.”\\n\\n“Please tell about it. I have horrid quarrels with Mamie Parsons\\nsometimes, but we always kiss and make up, and feel all happy again.\\nCan’t you, Cousin Penny?” asked the child, softly touching the\\nlittle white curls under the lace cap.\\n\\n“Well, no, dear; grown people cannot settle differences in that\\npretty way. We must wait till he apologizes, and then we shall\\ngladly be friends again. You see Mr. Dover was a missionary in India\\nfor many years, and we were very intimate with his mother. Our\\ngardens join, and a gate in our fence led across their field to the\\nback street, and was most convenient when we wanted to walk by the\\nriver or send the maids on errands in a hurry. The old lady was very\\nneighborly, and we were quite comfortable till Thomas came home and\\nmade trouble. He’d lost his wife and children, poor man, and his\\nliver was out of order, and living among the heathen so long had\\nmade him melancholy and queer; so he tried to amuse himself with\\ngardening and keeping hens.”\\n\\n“I’m glad! I love flowers and biddies,” murmured Rosy, listening\\nwith deep interest to this delightful mixture of quarrels and\\nheathen, sorrow, poultry, mysterious diseases, and gardens.\\n\\n“He had no right to shut up our gate and forbid our crossing that\\nlittle field, and no GENTLEMAN would have DARED to do it after all\\nour kindness to his mother,” exclaimed Miss Henny, so suddenly and\\nviolently that Rosamond nearly fell off the old lady’s lap with the\\nstart she gave.\\n\\n“No, sister, I don’t agree there. Mr. Thomas had a perfect RIGHT to\\ndo as he liked with his own land; but I think we should have had no\\ntrouble if you had been willing to sell him the corner of our garden\\nwhere the old summer-house is, for his hens,” began Miss Penny in a\\nmild tone.\\n\\n“Sister! you know the tender memories connected with that bower, and\\nhow terrible it would have been to ME to see it torn down, and noisy\\nfowls clucking and pecking where I and my poor Calvin once sat\\ntogether,” cried Miss Henny, trying to look sentimental, which was\\nan impossible feat for a stout lady in a flowery muslin gown, and a\\nfly-away cap full of blue ribbons, on a head once flaxen and now\\ngray.\\n\\n“We won’t discuss the point, Henrietta,” said the elder lady with\\ndignity; whereupon the other returned to the letter, bridling and\\ntossing her head in a way which caused Rosy to stare, and resolve to\\nimitate it when she played being a proud princess with her dolls.\\n\\n“Well, dear, that was the beginning of the trouble,” continued Miss\\nPenny; “and now we don’t speak, and the old lady misses us, I’m\\nsure, and I often long to run in and see her, and I’m so sorry you\\ncan’t enjoy the wonders of that house, for it’s full of beautiful\\nand curious things, most instructive for children to observe. Mr.\\nThomas has been a great traveller, and has a tiger skin in the\\nparlor so natural it’s quite startling to behold; also spears, and\\nbows and arrows, and necklaces of shark’s teeth, from the Cannibal\\nIslands, and the loveliest stuffed birds, my dear, all over the\\nplace, and pretty shells and baskets, and ivory toys, and odd\\ndresses, and no end of wonderful treasures. Such a sad pity you\\ncan’t see them!” and Miss Penny looked quite distressed at the\\nchild’s loss.\\n\\n“Oh, but I guess I will see ‘em! Every one is good to me, and old\\ngentlemen like little girls. Papa says so, and HE always does what I\\nwant when I say ‘Please’ with my wheedulin smile, as he calls it,”\\n said Rosy, giving them a sample of the most engaging sort.\\n\\n“You funny little thing, do try it, and soften the heart of that\\ntiresome man! He has the finest roses in town and the most delicious\\nfruit, and we never get any, though he sends quantities everywhere\\nelse. Such a fuss over an old ear-wiggy arbor! It is perfectly\\nprovoking, when we might enjoy so much over there; and who knows\\nwhat might happen!”\\n\\nAs Cicely spoke, she smoothed her brown curls and glanced at the\\nmirror, quite conscious that a very pretty young lady of twenty was\\nwasting her sweetness in the great gloomy house, with two elderly\\nspinsters.\\n\\n“I’ll get some for you,” answered Rosy, with a nod of such calm\\nconviction of her own power, that Cicely laughed again, and proposed\\nthat she should go at once and view the battle-field.\\n\\n“Could I RUN in the garden? I’d love to, after riding so long,”\\n asked Rosy, eager to be off; for her active legs ached for exercise,\\nand the close, shady room oppressed her.\\n\\n“Yes, dear; but don’t get into mischief, or worry Tabby, or pick the\\nflowers. Of course you wouldn’t touch green fruit, or climb trees,\\nor soil your little frock. I’ll ring the bell for you to come in and\\nbe dressed for tea when it is time.”\\n\\nWith these directions and a kiss, Miss Penny, as Cicely did not\\nstir, let the child out at the back door of the long hall, and\\nwatched her walk demurely down the main path of the prim old garden,\\nwhere no child had played for years, and even the toads and fat\\nrobins behaved in the most decorous manner.\\n\\n“It’s pretty dull, but it’s better than the parlor with all the\\nstaring pictures,” said Rosy to herself, after a voyage of discovery\\nhad shown her the few charms of the place. The sight of a large\\nyellow cat reposing in the sun cheered her eyes at that moment, and\\nshe hastened to scrape acquaintance with the stately animal; for the\\nsnails were not social, and the toads stared even more fixedly at\\nher than the painted eyes of her respected ancestors.\\n\\nBut Tabby disliked children as much as her mistress, and after\\nsubmitting ungraciously to a few caresses from the eager little\\nhands, she rose and retired majestically to a safer perch on the top\\nof the high wall which enclosed the garden. Being too lazy to jump,\\nshe walked up the shelves of an old flower-stand moulding in a\\ncorner, and by so doing, gave Rosy a brilliant idea, which she at\\nonce put into action by following Tabby’s example. Up this new sort\\nof ladder she went, and peeped over the wall, delighted at this\\nunexpected chance to behold the enemy’s territory.\\n\\n“Oh, what a pretty place!” she cried, clasping her grubby little\\nhands with rapture, as the beauties of the forbidden land burst upon\\nher view.\\n\\nIt was indeed a paradise to a child’s eyes,--for flowers bloomed\\nalong the winding paths; ripening fruit lay rosy and tempting in the\\nbeds below; behind the wire walls that confined them clucked and\\nstrutted various sorts of poultry; cages of gay birds hung on the\\npiazza; and through the open windows of the house one caught\\nglimpses of curious curtains, bright weapons, and mysterious objects\\nin the rooms beyond.\\n\\nA gray-headed gentleman in a queer nankeen coat lay asleep on a\\nbamboo lounge under the great cherry-tree, with a purple silk\\nhandkerchief half over his face.\\n\\n“That’s the missionary man, I s’pose. He doesn’t look cross at all.\\nIf I could only get down there, I’d go and wake him with a softly\\nkiss, as I do Papa, and ask to see his pretty things.”\\n\\nBeing quite unconscious of fear, Rosy certainly would have carried\\nout her daring plan, had it been possible; but no way of descending\\non the other side appeared, so she sighed and sat gazing wistfully,\\ntill Cousin Henny appeared for a breath of fresh air, and ordered\\nher down at once.\\n\\n“Come and see if my balsam-seeds have started yet. I keep planting\\nthem, but they WON’T come up,” she said, pointing out a mound of\\nearth newly dug and watered.\\n\\nRosy obediently scrambled up, and was trying to decide whether some\\ngreen sprouts were chickweed or the dilatory balsams when a sudden\\nuproar in the next garden made her stop to listen, while Miss Henny\\nsaid in a tone of great satisfaction, as the cackle of hens arose,--\\n\\n“Some trouble with those horrid fowls of his. I detest them, crowing\\nin the night, and waking us at dawn with their noise. I wish some\\nthief would steal every one of them. Nobody has a right to annoy\\ntheir neighbors with troublesome pets.”\\n\\nBefore Rosy could describe the beauties of the white bantams or the\\nsize of the big golden cock, a loud voice cried,--\\n\\n“You rascal! I’ll hang you if I catch you here again. Go home\\nquicker than you came, and tell your mistress to teach you better\\nmanners, if she values your life.”\\n\\n“It’s that man! Such language! I wonder who he’s caught? That bad\\nboy who steals our plums, perhaps.”\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of Miss Henny’s mouth when her question\\nwas answered in a sudden and dreadful way; for over the wall, hurled\\nby a strong arm, flew Tabby, high in the air, to fall with a thump\\ndirectly in the middle of the bed where they stood. Miss Henny\\nuttered a shrill scream, caught up her stunned treasure, and rushed\\ninto the house as fast as her size and flounces permitted, leaving\\nRosy breathless with surprise and indignation.\\n\\nBurning to resent this terrible outrage, she climbed quickly up the\\nsteps, and astonished the irate old gentleman on the other side by\\nthe sudden apparition of a golden head, a red childish face, and a\\ndirty little finger pointed sternly at him, as this small avenging\\nangel demanded,--\\n\\n“Missionary man, how COULD you kill my cousin’s cat?”\\n\\n“Bless my soul! who are you?” said the old gentleman, staring at\\nthis unexpected actor on the field of battle.\\n\\n“I’m Button-Rose, and I hate cruel people! Tabby’s dead, and now\\nthere isn’t any one to play with over here.”\\n\\nThis sad prospect made the blue eyes fill with sudden tears; and the\\napplication of the dirty fingers added streaks of mud to the red\\ncheeks, which much damaged the appearance of the angel, thought it\\nadded pathos to the child’s reproach.\\n\\n“Cats have nine lives, and Tabby’s used to being chucked over the\\nwall. I’ve done it several times, and it seems to agree with her,\\nfor she comes back to kill my chicks as bold as brass. See that!”\\n and the old gentleman held up a downy dead chicken, as proof of\\nTabby’s sin.\\n\\n“Poor little chicky!” groaned Rosy, yearning to mourn over the dear\\ndeparted and bury it with tender care. “It WAS very naughty of Tab;\\nbut, sir, you know cats are made to catch things, and they can’t\\nhelp it.”\\n\\n“They will have to help it, or I’ll drown the lot. This is a rare\\nbreed, and I’ve but two left after all my trouble, thanks to that\\nrascal of yours! What are you going to do about it?” demanded Mr.\\nDover, in a tone that made Rosy feel as if she had committed the\\nmurder herself.\\n\\n“I’ll talk to Tabby and try to make her good, and I’ll shut her up\\nin the old rabbit-house over here; then I hope she will be sorry and\\nnever do it any more,” she said, in such a remorseful tone that the\\nold gentleman relented at once, ashamed to afflict such a tender\\nlittle soul.\\n\\n“Try it,” he said, with a smile that made his yellow face pleasant\\nall at once. Then, as if ready to change the subject, he asked,\\nlooking curiously at the little figure perched on the wall,--\\n\\n“Where did you come from? Never saw any children over there before.\\nThey don’t allow ‘em.”\\n\\nRosy introduced herself in a few words, and seeing that her new\\nacquaintance seemed interested, she added with the wheedling smile\\nPapa found so engaging,--\\n\\n“It’s pretty lonely here, I guess; so p’r’aps you’ll let me peep at\\nyour nice garden sometimes if it doesn’t trouble you, sir?”\\n\\n“Poor little soul! it must be desperately dull with those three\\ntabbies,” he said to himself, as he stroked the dead chicken in his\\nhand, and watched the little face bent toward him.\\n\\n“Peep as much as you like, child; or, better still, come over and\\nrun about. _I_ like little girls,” he added aloud, with a nod and a\\nwave of welcome.\\n\\n“I told ‘em I was sure you did! I’d love to come, but they wouldn’t\\nlet me, I know. I’m so sorry about the fight. Couldn’t you make it\\nup, and be pleasant again?” asked Rosy, clasping her hands with a\\nbeseeching gesture as her bright face grew sad and serious\\nremembering the feud.\\n\\n“So they’ve told you that nonsense already, have they? Nice\\nneighbors THEY are,” said the old gentleman, frowning as if ill\\npleased at the news.\\n\\n“I’m glad I know; p’r’aps I can be a peace-maker. Mamma says they\\nare good to have in families, and I’d like to be one if I could.\\nWould you mind if I tried to peace-make a little, so I could come\\nover? I do want to see the red birds and the tiger skin awfully, if\\nyou please.”\\n\\n“What do you know about ‘em?” asked the old gentleman, sitting down\\non a garden chair, as if he didn’t mind continuing the chat with\\nthis new neighbor.\\n\\nNearly tumbling off the wall in her earnestness, Rosy repeated all\\nthat Cousin Penny had said; and something in the reasonable words,\\nthe flattering description of his treasures, and the sincere regret\\nof the old lady seemed to have a good effect upon Mr. Dover, for\\nwhen Rosy paused out of breath, he said in such an altered tone that\\nit was evident the peacemaking had already begun,--\\n\\n“Miss Carey is a gentlewoman! I always thought so. You tell her,\\nwith my compliments, that I’d be glad to see you any time if she has\\nno objection. I’ll put my step-ladder there, and you can come over\\ninstead of the cat. But mind you don’t meddle, or I might give you a\\ntoss like Tabby.”\\n\\n“I’m not afraid,” laughed Rosy. “I’ll go and ask right away, and I\\nwon’t touch a thing, and I know you’ll like me for a friend. Papa\\nsays I’m a dear little one. Thank you very much, sir. Good-by till I\\ncome again;” and with a kiss of the hand, the yellow head sunk out\\nof sight like the sun going down, leaving a sense of darkness behind\\nwhen the beaming little face disappeared, though fresh stains of\\ngreen mould from the wall made it rather like the tattooed\\ncountenances Mr. Dover used to see among his cannibal friends in\\nAfrica.\\n\\nHe sat musing with the dead chicken in his hand, forgetful of time,\\ntill a ring of his own door-bell called him in to receive a note\\nfrom Miss Penelope, thanking him for his invitation to little\\nRosamond, but declining it in the most polite and formal words.\\n\\n“I expected it! Bless the silly old souls! why can’t they be\\nreasonable, and accept the olive branch when I offer it? I’ll be\\nhanged if I do again! The fat one is at the bottom of this. Miss Pen\\nwould give in if that absurd Henrietta didn’t hold her back. Well,\\nI’m sorry for the child, but that’s not my fault;” and throwing down\\nthe note, he went out to water his roses.\\n\\nFor a week or two, Button-Rose hardly dared glance toward the\\nforbidden spot from her window, as she was ordered to play in the\\nfront garden, and sent to take sober walks with Cicely, who loved to\\nstop and gossip with her friends, while the poor child waited\\npatiently till the long tales were told.\\n\\nNursing Tabby was her chief consolation; and so kind was she, that\\nthe heart of the old cat softened to her, and she actually purred\\nher thanks at last, for all the saucers of cream, bits of chicken,\\nsoft pats, and tender words bestowed upon her by the little girl.\\n\\n“Well, I declare! Tab won’t do that even for me,” said Miss Henny,\\none day when she came upon the child sitting alone in the hall with\\na picture-book and the cat comfortably asleep in her lap.\\n\\n“Ammals always love me, if people don’t,” answered Button-Rose,\\nsoberly; for she had not yet forgiven the stout lady for denying her\\nthe delights offered by the “missionary man.”\\n\\n“That’s because AN-I-MALS can’t see how naughty you are sometimes,”\\n said Miss Henny tartly, not having recovered her temper even after\\nmany days.\\n\\n“I shall make EVERY one love me before I go away. Mamma told me to,\\nand I shall. I know how;” and Button smiled with a wise little nod\\nthat was pretty to see, as she proudly cuddled her first conquest.\\n\\n“We shall see;” and Miss Henny ponderously departed, wondering what\\nodd fancy the little thing would take into her head next.\\n\\nIt was soon evident; for when she came down from her long nap, later\\nin the afternoon, Miss Henny found Rosamond reading aloud to her\\nsister in the great dim parlor. They made a curious contrast,--the\\npale, white-haired, feeble old lady, with her prim dress, high cap,\\nknitting, and shaded eyes; and the child, rosy and round, quaint and\\nsweet, a pretty little ornament for the old-fashioned room, as she\\nsat among the tea-poys and samplers, ancient china and furniture,\\nwith the portraits of great grandfathers and grandmothers simpering\\nand staring at her, as if pleased and surprised to see such a\\ncharming little descendant among them.\\n\\n“Bless the baby! what is she at now?” asked Miss Henny, feeling more\\namiable after her sleep.\\n\\n“I’m reading to Cousin Penny, ‘cause no one else does, and her poor\\neyes hurt her, and she likes stories, and so do I,” answered Button,\\nwith one chubby finger on the place in her book, and eyes full of\\npride at the grown-up employment she had found for herself.\\n\\n“So kind of the little dear! She found me alone and wanted to amuse\\nme; so I proposed a story to suit us both, and she does very well\\nwith a little help now and then. I haven’t read ‘Simple Susan’ for\\nyears, and really enjoy it. Maria Edgeworth was always a favorite of\\nmine, and I still think her far superior to any modern writer for\\nthe young,” said Miss Penny, looking quite animated and happy in the\\nnew entertainment provided for her.\\n\\n“Go on, child; let me hear how well you can read;” and Miss Henny\\nsettled herself in the sofa-corner with her embroidery.\\n\\nSo Button started bravely on, and tried so hard that she was soon\\nout of breath. As she paused, she said with a gasp,--\\n\\n“Isn’t Susan a dear girl? She gives ALL the best things to other\\npeople, and is kind to the old harper. She didn’t send him away, as\\nyou did the music-man to-day, and tell him to be still.”\\n\\n“Organs are a nuisance, and I never allow them here. Go on, and\\ndon’t criticise your elders, Rosamond.”\\n\\n“Mamma and I always talk over stories, and pick out the morals of\\n‘em. SHE likes it;” with which remark, made sweetly not pertly,\\nButton went on to the end, with an occasional lift over a long word;\\nand the old ladies were interested, in spite of themselves, in the\\nsimple tale read in that childish voice.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear, it is very nice, and we will have one every day.\\nNow, what can I do for you?” asked Miss Penny, as the little girl\\npushed the curls off her forehead, with a sigh of mingled weariness\\nand satisfaction.\\n\\n“Let me go in the back garden and peep through the knot-hole at the\\npretty roses. I do long to see if the moss ones are out, and the\\ncherries ripe,” said Rosy, clasping her hands imploringly.\\n\\n“It can do no harm, Henrietta. Yes, dear, run away and get some\\ncatnip for Tabby, and see if the balsams are up yet.”\\n\\nThat last suggestion won Miss Henny’s consent; and Button was off at\\nonce, skipping like a young colt all over the garden, which now\\nseemed delightful to her.\\n\\nAt the back of the summer-house was a narrow space between it and\\nthe fence where certain plump toads lived; peeping in to watch them,\\nRosy had spied a large knot-hole in the old boards, and through it\\nfound she could get a fine view of several rose-bushes, a tree, and\\none window of the “missionary man’s” house. She had longed for\\nanother peep since the flower-stand was gone, and climbing trees\\nforbidden; now with joy she slipped into the damp nook, regardless\\nof the speckled gentlemen who stared at her with dismay, and took a\\ngood look at the forbidden paradise beyond.\\n\\nYes, the “moss ones” were in bloom, the cherries quite red, and at\\nthe window was the gray head of Mr. Dover, as he sat reading in his\\nqueer yellow dressing-gown.\\n\\nButton yearned to get in, and leaned so hard against the hateful\\nfence that the rotten board cracked, a long bit fell out, and she\\nnearly went after it, as it dropped upon the green bank below. Now\\nthe full splendor of the roses burst upon her, and a delightful\\ngooseberry bush stood close by with purplish berries temptingly\\nbobbing within reach. This obliging bush hid the hole, but left fine\\nopenings to see through; so the child popped her curly head out, and\\ngazed delightedly at the chickens, the flowers, the fruit, and the\\nunconscious old gentleman not far away.\\n\\n“I’ll have it for my secret; or maybe I’ll tell Cousin Penny, and\\nbeg her to let me peep if I truly promise never to go in,” thought\\nButton, knowing well who her best friend was.\\n\\nAt bedtime, when the dear old lady came to give the good-night kiss,\\nwhich the others forgot, Rosy, as Miss Penny called her, made her\\nrequest; and it was granted, for Miss Penny had a feeling that the\\nlittle peacemaker would sooner or later heal the breach with her\\npretty magic, and so she was very ready to lend a hand in a quiet\\nway.\\n\\nNext day at play-time, Button was hurrying down her last bit of\\ngingerbread, which she was obliged to eat properly in the\\ndining-room, instead of enjoying out-of-doors, when she heard a\\nsudden flurry in the garden, and running to the window saw Roxy the\\nmaid chasing a chicken to and fro, while Miss Henny stood flapping\\nher skirts on the steps, and crying, “Shoo!” till she was red in the\\nface.\\n\\n“It’s the white banty, and it must have come in my hole! Oh dear, I\\nhope they won’t catch it! Cousin Henny said she’d wring the neck of\\nthe first one that flied over the wall.”\\n\\nAway went Rosy, to join in the hunt; for Miss Henny was too fat to\\nrun, and Roxy found the lively fowl too much for her. It was a long\\nand hard chase; feathers flew, the maid lost her breath, Rosy\\ntumbled down, and Miss Henny screamed and scolded till she was\\nforced to sit down and watch in silence.\\n\\nAt last poor, hunted Banty ran into the arbor, for its clipped wings\\nwould not lift it over the wall. Button rushed after it, and dismal\\nsqualls plainly proclaimed that the naughty chicken was caught.\\n\\nMiss Henny waddled down the path, declaring that she WOULD wring its\\nneck; and Roxy went puffing after her, glad to rest. But the old\\nsummer-house was empty. No little girl, no ruffled bantam, appeared.\\nBoth had vanished like magic; and mistress and maid stared at each\\nother in amazement, till they saw that the long-disused window was\\nopen, and a gleam of light came in from the narrow opening behind.\\n\\n“My patience! if that child hasn’t crept out there, and bolted\\nthrough that hole in the fence! Did you ever, Miss?” exclaimed Roxy,\\ntrying not to look pleased at being spared the distasteful task of\\nkilling the poor chicken.\\n\\n“Naughty girl!” began Miss Henny, when the sound of voices made both\\nlisten. “Slip in there, and see what is going on,” said the\\nmistress, well knowing that her stout person never could be squeezed\\ninto the small space between house and fence.\\n\\nRoxy, being thin, easily obeyed, and in a whisper telephoned what\\nwent on beyond the hole, causing Miss Henny much vexation, surprise,\\nand at last real pleasure, as the child performed her little part in\\nthe mission she had undertaken.\\n\\n“Oh, please, it’s all my fault! I kept the hole open, Mr. Thomas,\\nand so Banty flied in. But it isn’t hurt a bit, and I’ve brought it\\nhome all safe, ‘cause I know you love your chickies, and Tabby ate\\nlots of ‘em,” said the childish voice in its most conciliatory tone.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you fling it over the wall, as I did the cat?” asked Mr.\\nDover, smiling, as he shut up the truant fowl, and turned to look at\\nthe rosy, breathless child, whose pink frock bore the marks of many\\na tumble on grass and gravel.\\n\\n“It would hurt Banty’s feelings, and yours too, and not be polite.\\nSo I came myself, to make some pollygies, and say it was my fault.\\nBut, please, could I keep the hole to peep through, if I always put\\nup a board when I go away? It is so dull in there, and SO sweet in\\nhere!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think a little gate would be nicer,--one just big enough\\nfor you, with a hook to fasten it? We’ll call it a button-hole,”\\n laughed Mr. Dover. “Then you could peep; or perhaps the ladies will\\nthink better of it, and show that they pardon my ill treatment of\\nTabby by letting you come in and pick some cherries and roses now\\nand then.”\\n\\nThis charming proposal caused the little girl to clasp her hands and\\ncry aloud,--\\n\\n“That would be perfully sp’endid! I know Cousin Penny would like it,\\nand let me. P’r’aps she’d come herself; she’s so thin, she could,\\nand she loves your mother and wants to see her. Only, Cousin Henny\\nwon’t let us be nice and friendly. S’pose you send HER some\\ncherries; she loves good things to eat, and maybe she will say yes,\\nif you send lots.”\\n\\nMr. Dover laughed at this artless proposal, and Miss Henny smiled at\\nthe prospect of a gift of the luscious black-heart cherries she had\\nbeen longing for. Roxy wisely repeated only the agreeable parts of\\nthe conversation; so nothing ruffled the lady’s temper. Now, whether\\nMr. Dover’s sharp eye caught a glimpse of the face among the\\ngooseberry bushes, and suspected eavesdroppers, or whether the\\nchild’s earnest desire to make peace touched him, who shall say?\\nCertain it is that his eyes twinkled like a boy’s, as he said rather\\nloudly, in his most affable tone,--\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to send Miss Henrietta a basket of fruit. She\\nused to be a charming young woman. It’s a pity she shuts herself up\\nso much; but that sad little romance of hers has darkened her life,\\nI suppose. Ah, well, I can sympathize with her!”\\n\\nRosy stared at the sudden change in his manner, and was rather\\nbewildered by his grown-up way of talking to her. But being intent\\non securing something nice to carry home, she stuck to the cherries,\\nwhich she DID understand, and pointing to the piazza said with a\\nbusiness-like air,--\\n\\n“There’s a basket; so we might pick ‘em right away. I love to go up\\nin trees and throw ‘em down; and I know Cousin Henny will like\\ncherries ever so much, and not scold a bit when I take some to her.”\\n\\n“Then come on,” cried Mr. Thomas, relapsing into the hearty manner\\nshe liked so much; and away he went, quite briskly, down the path,\\nwith his yellow skirts waving in the wind, and Button skipping after\\nhim in great glee.\\n\\n“They actually ARE a-picking cherries, Miss, up in the tree like a\\ncouple of robins a-chirpin’ and laughin’ as gay as can be,” reported\\nRoxy, from her peep-hole.\\n\\n“Rip off the rest of that board, then I can see,” whispered Miss\\nHenny, quivering with interest now; for she had heard Mr. Dover’s\\nwords, and her wrath was appeased by that flattering allusion to\\nherself.\\n\\nOff came the rest of the board, and from the window, half hidden in\\nwoodbine, she could now see over the bushes into the next garden.\\nThe peep-hole commanded the tree, and she watched with eager eyes\\nthe filling of the basket to be sent her, planning the while a\\ncharming note of thanks.\\n\\n“Do look, Miss; they are resting now, and she’s on his knee. Ain’t\\nit a pretty picter?” whispered Roxy, unmindful of the earwigs, ants,\\nand daddy-long-legs promenading over her as she crouched in her\\nmouldy corner, intent on the view beyond.\\n\\n“Very pretty! He lost several children in India and I suppose Rosy\\nreminds him of them. Ah, poor man! I can sympathize with him, for\\n_I_ too have loved and lost,” sighed Miss Henny, pensively surveying\\nthe group on the rustic seat.\\n\\nThey were playing cherry-bob; and the child’s laughter made pleasant\\nmusic in the usually quiet place, while the man’s face lost its sad,\\nstern look, and was both gay and tender, as he held the little\\ncreature close, and popped the ripe fruit into the red, laughing\\nmouth.\\n\\nAs the last sweet morsel disappeared Rosy said, with a long breath\\nof perfect content,--\\n\\n“It’s ALMOST as good as having Papa to play with. I do hope the\\ncousins WILL let me come again! If they don’t, I think my heart will\\nbreak, ‘cause I get so homesick over there, and have so many trials,\\nand no one but Cousin Penny ever cuddles me.”\\n\\n“Bless her heart! We’ll send her some flowers for that. You tell her\\nthat Mrs. Dover is poorly, and would like very much to see her; and\\nso would Mr. Thomas, who enjoys her little niece immensely. Can you\\nremember that?”\\n\\n“Every word! SHE is very nice to me, and I love her, and I guess she\\nwill be glad to come. She likes MOSS-roses, and so do I,” added the\\nunblushing little beggar, as Mr. Dover took out his knife and began\\nto make the bouquet which was to be Miss Penny’s bribe. He could not\\nbear to give up his little playmate, and was quite ready to try\\nagain, with this persistent and charming ally to help him heal the\\nbreach.\\n\\n“Shall you send anything to Cis? You needn’t mind about it, ‘cause\\nshe can’t keep me at home, but it might please her, and make her\\nstop rapping my head with her thimble when I ask questions, and\\nslapping my fingers when I touch any of her pretty things,”\\n suggested Button, as the flowers were added to the fruit, making\\na fine display.\\n\\n“I never send presents to YOUNG ladies,” said Mr. Thomas shortly,\\nadding, with both hands out, and his most inviting smile, “But I\\nALWAYS kiss nice little girls if they will allow me?”\\n\\nButton threw both arms about his neck and gave him a shower of\\ngrateful kisses, which were sweeter to the lonely old man than all\\nthe cherries that ever grew, or the finest flowers in his garden.\\nThen Miss Rosamond proudly marched home, finding no trace of the\\nwatchers, for both had fled while the “cuddling” went on. Roxy was\\nsoberly setting the dinner-table, and Miss Henny in the parlor\\nbreathing hard behind a newspaper. Miss Penny and Cicely were\\nspending the day out, so the roses had to wait; but the basket was\\nmost graciously received, also the carefully delivered message, and\\nthe child’s heart was rejoiced by free permission to go and see “our\\nkind neighbor now and then, if Sister does not object.”\\n\\nRosy was in great spirits, and prattled away as they sat at dinner,\\nemboldened by the lady’s unusual amiability to ask all sorts of\\nquestions, some of which proved rather embarrassing to Miss Henny,\\nand very amusing to Roxy, listening in the china-closet.\\n\\n“I wish _I_ had ‘spepsia,” was the abrupt remark of the small person\\nas her plate of drum-sticks was removed and the pudding appeared,\\naccompanied by the cherries.\\n\\n“Why, dear?” asked Miss Henny, busily arranging the small dish of\\ndelicate tidbits, which left little but the skeleton of the roast\\nfowl for the kitchen.\\n\\n“Then I could have the nicest bits of chicken, and heaps of sauce on\\nmy pudding, and the butteryest slices of toast, and ALL the cream\\nfor my tea, as you do. It isn’t a VERY bad pain, is it?” asked Rosy,\\nin such perfect good faith that Miss Henny’s sudden flush and Roxy’s\\nhasty dive into the closet never suggested to her that this innocent\\nspeech was bringing the old lady’s besetting sin to light in the\\nmost open manner.\\n\\n“Yes, child, it is VERY bad, and you may thank your stars that I try\\nto keep you from it by feeding you on plain food. At my age, and\\nsuffering as I do, the best of everything is needed to keep up my\\nstrength,” said Miss Henny, tartly. But the largest plate of\\npudding, with “heaps of sauce,” went to the child this day, and when\\nthe fruit was served, an unusually small portion was put away for\\nthe invalid, who was obliged to sustain nature with frequent lunches\\nthrough the day and evening.\\n\\n“I’m s’prised that you suffer much, Cousin Henny. How brave you must\\nbe, not to cry about it, and go round in horrid pain, as you do, and\\ndress so nicely, and see people, and work ‘broidering, and make\\ncalls! I hope I shall be brave if I ever DO have ‘spepsia; but I\\nguess I shan’t, you take such care to give me small pieces every\\ntime.”\\n\\nWith which cheerful remark Rosy closed that part of the conversation\\nand returned to the delights of her new friend’s garden. But from\\nthat day, among other changes which began about this time, the\\nchild’s cup and plate were well filled, and the dread of adding to\\nher own sufferings seemed to curb the dyspeptic’s voracious\\nappetite. “A cheild was amang them takin’ notes,” and every one\\ninvoluntarily dreaded those clear eyes and that frank tongue, so\\ninnocently observing and criticising all that went on. Cicely had\\nalready been reminded of a neglected duty by Rosy’s reading to Miss\\nPenny, and tried to be more faithful in that, as in other services\\nwhich she owed the old lady. So the little missionary was evidently\\ngetting on, though quite unconscious of her work at home, so\\nabsorbed was she in her foreign mission; for, like many another\\nmissionary, the savage over the way was more interesting than the\\nselfish, slothful, or neglected souls at home.\\n\\nMiss Penny was charmed with her flowers and the friendly message\\nsent her, and to Rosy’s great delight went next day, in best bonnet\\nand gown, to make a call upon the old lady “who was poorly,” for\\nthat appeal could not be resisted. Rosy also, in honor of the great\\noccasion, wore HER best hat, and a white frock so stiff that she\\nlooked like a little opera dancer as the long black legs skipped\\nalong the street; for it was far too grand a visit to be paid\\nthrough a hole in the wall.\\n\\nIn the basket were certain delicacies for the old lady, and a card\\nhad been prepared, with the names of Miss Carey and Miss Rosamond\\nCarey beautifully written on it by Cis, who was dying to go, but\\ndared not after Rosy had told her Mr. Dover’s remark about young\\nladies.\\n\\nAs the procession of two paused at the door, both the young and the\\nold heart fluttered a little, for this was the first decided step\\ntoward reconciliation, and any check might spoil it all. The maid\\nstared, but civilly led these unexpected guests in and departed with\\nthe card. Miss Penny settled herself in a large chair and looked\\nabout with pensive interest at the familiar room. But Rosy made a\\nbee-line for the great tiger-skin, and regardless of her clean\\nfrock lay down on it to examine the head, which glared at her with\\nyellow eyes, showing all its sharp teeth in the most delightfully\\nnatural manner.\\n\\nMr. Dover came in with a formal bow, but Miss Penny put out both\\nhands, and said in her sweet old voice,--\\n\\n“Let us be friends again for the sake of your mother.”\\n\\nThat settled the matter at once, and Mr. Thomas was so eager to do\\nhis part that he not only shook the hands heartily, but kept them in\\nhis as he said like an honest man,--\\n\\n“My dear neighbor, I beg your pardon! _I_ was wrong, but I’m not too\\nproud to own it and say I’m glad to let by-gones be by-gones for the\\nsake of all. Now come and see my mother; she is longing for you.”\\n\\nWhat went on in the next room Rosy never knew or cared, for Mr.\\nThomas soon returned, and amused her so well, showing his treasures,\\nthat she forgot where she was till the maid came to say tea was\\nready.\\n\\n“Are we going to stay?” cried the little girl, beaming from under a\\nFeejee crown of feathers, which produced as comical an effect upon\\nher curly head as did the collar of shark’s teeth round her plump\\nneck or the great Japanese war-fan in her hand.\\n\\n“Yes, we have tea at five; come and turn it out. I’ve ordered the\\nlittle cups especially for you,” said her host, as he changed the\\nsmall Amazon to a pretty child again and led her away to preside at\\nthe table, where the quaint china and silver, and the dainty cake\\nand bread and butter proved much more attractive than the little old\\nlady in a big cap who patted her head and smiled at her.\\n\\nNever had Rosy enjoyed such a delicious meal; for the rapture of\\npouring real tea out of a pot shaped like a silver melon, into cups\\nas thin as egg-shells, and putting in sugar with tongs like claws,\\nnot to mention much thick cream, also spicy, plummy cakes that\\nmelted in one’s mouth, was too great for words.\\n\\nThe little maid was so absorbed in her new duties that she never\\nminded what the elders talked about, till the plates were empty, the\\npot ran dry, and no one could be prevailed on to have any more tea.\\nThen she leaned back in her chair and remarked with an air of calm\\nsatisfaction, as she looked from one to the other, and smiled that\\nengaging smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Isn’t being friends a great deal nicer than fighting and throwing\\ncats over walls and calling bad names?”\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh, and that cheerful sound seemed to\\ntune every one to the sweetest harmony, while the little peacemaker\\nwas passed round as if a last course of kisses was absolutely\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThen the party broke up, and Mr. Dover escorted his guests to their\\nown gate, to the great amazement of the neighbors and the very\\nvisible pride of Miss Button-Rose, who went up the walk with her\\nhead as high as if the wreath of daisies on her little hat had been\\na conqueror’s crown.\\n\\nNow that the first step had been taken, all would have gone smoothly\\nif Cicely, offended because Mr. Thomas took no notice of HER, had\\nnot put it into Miss Henny’s head that as the original quarrel began\\nbetween her and their neighbor, it would not be dignified to give in\\ntill Mr. Dover had come and begged pardon of HER as well as of Miss\\nPenny. This suited the foolish old lady, who never could forget\\ncertain plain words spoken in the heat of battle, though the kindly\\nones lately heard had much softened her heart toward the offender.\\n\\n“No, I shall not forget my dignity nor humble myself by going over\\nthere to apologize as Penelope has. SHE can do as she likes; and now\\nthat he has asked to be forgiven, there is perhaps no harm in HER\\nseeing the old lady. But with me it is different. _I_ was insulted,\\nand till Thomas Dover comes here and solemnly asks my pardon I will\\nNOT cross his threshold, no matter what bribes he sends,” said Miss\\nHenny, with an air of heroic firmness.\\n\\nBut it did cost her a pang when her sister went every now and then\\nto take tea with the old lady and came home full of pleasant news;\\nwhile Rosy prattled of the fine things she saw, the nice things she\\nhad to eat, and never failed to bring some gift to share, or to\\ndisplay to the exiles from Paradise. They ate the “bribes,” however,\\nas they called the fruit, admired the pretty trinkets and toys, and\\nlonged to share in the mild festivities of the pleasant house over\\nthe way, but stood firm in spite of all Rosy’s wiles, till something\\nunexpected happened to touch their hearts, conquer their foolish\\npride, and crown the little peacemaker’s efforts with success.\\n\\nOne August afternoon Cicely was discontentedly looking over her\\nsmall store of ornaments as she made ready for a party. She loved\\ngayety, and went about a great deal, leaving many duties undone, or\\nasking the little girl to attend to them for her, neglecting,\\nhowever, to show any gratitude for these small services so\\ncheerfully done.\\n\\nAs she sat tossing over her boxes, Button-Rose came in looking\\ntired and listless, for it was a hot day, and she had been out twice\\nto do errands for Cicely, besides trotting busily up and down to\\nwait on the old ladies while the young one put fresh ribbons on her\\ndress and curled her hair for the evening.\\n\\n“Could I lie on your sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and my legs\\nare SO tired,” said little Button, when her tap had been answered by\\na sharp “What do you want, child?”\\n\\n“No, I’m going to lie there myself and have a nap as soon as I’m\\ndone here. It’s cooler than the bed, and I must be fresh for\\nto-night,” said Cicely, too intent on her own affairs to see how\\nused up Rosy looked.\\n\\n“Then could I look at your pretty things if I don’t touch ‘em?”\\n asked the child, longing to peep into the interesting boxes\\nscattered on the table.\\n\\n“No, you can’t! I’m busy, and don’t want you asking questions and\\nmeddling. Go away and let me alone.”\\n\\nCicely spoke crossly, and waved her hand with a warning gesture,\\nthereby upsetting the tray which held the beads of the necklace she\\nhad decided to wear for want of something better.\\n\\n“There, now see what you’ve done! Pick up every one, and be quick,\\nfor I’m in a hurry.”\\n\\n“But I didn’t touch ‘em,” began poor Button, as she crept about\\nhunting for the black and white beads that looked like very ugly\\nmarbles.\\n\\n“Don’t talk; pick them up and then scamper; you are always in\\nmischief!” scolded Cis, vexed with herself, and the heat, and the\\naccident, and the whole world just then.\\n\\nRosy said no more, but several great tears dropped on the carpet as\\nshe groped in corners, under the bed, and behind the chairs for the\\nrun-aways; and when the last was found she put it in her tyrant’s\\nhand, saying, with a wistful look,--\\n\\n“I’m very sorry I troubled you. Seems to me if _I_ had a little\\ncousin, I’d love to have her play with my things, and I wouldn’t be\\ncross to her. Now I’ll go and try to AMOOSE myself with Bella; SHE\\nis always good to me.”\\n\\n“Run along then. Thank goodness that doll came when it did, for I’m\\ntired of ‘amoosing’ small girls as well as old ladies,” said Cis,\\nbusy with her beads, yet sorry she had been so petulant with patient\\nlittle Button, who seldom reproached her, being a cheery child, and\\nblessed with a sweet temper.\\n\\nRosy felt too languid to play; so when she had told Bella, the\\nLondon doll, her trials, and comforted herself with some kisses on\\nthe waxen cheeks, she roamed away to the summer-house, which was\\ncool and quiet, longing for some one to caress her; for the little\\nheart was homesick and the little head ached badly.\\n\\nThe “button-hole” had been made, the alley swept out, to the great\\ndismay of the spiders, earwigs, and toads, who had fled to quieter\\nquarters, and Rosy had leave to go and come when she liked if Mr.\\nDover did not object. He never did; and it was her greatest delight\\nto walk in the pretty garden at her own sweet will, always with the\\nhope of meeting its kindly owner, for now they were firm friends.\\nShe had been too busy for a run there that day; and now, as she\\npeeped in, it looked so shady and inviting, and it seemed so natural\\nto turn to her dear “missionary man” for entertainment, that she\\nwent straight up to his study window and peeped in.\\n\\nHe too seemed out of sorts that hot afternoon, for he sat leaning\\nhis head on both hands at the desk strewn with piles of old letters.\\nButton-Rose’s tender heart yearned over him at once, and stepping\\nquietly in at the long open window she went to him, saying in her\\ntenderest tone,--\\n\\n“Does your head ache, sir? Let me soft it as I do Papa’s; he says\\nthat always makes it more better. Please let me? I’d love to\\ndearly.”\\n\\n“Ah, my darling, I wish you could. But the pain is in my heart, and\\nnothing will ever cure it,” sighed Mr. Thomas, as he drew her close\\nand put his wrinkled yellow cheek to her soft one, which looked more\\nlike a damask rose than usual.\\n\\n“You have trials too, I s’pose. Mine trouble me to-day, so I came\\nover to see you. Shall I go away?” asked Rosy with a sigh and the\\nwistful look again.\\n\\n“No, stay, and we will comfort each other. Tell me your troubles,\\nButton, and perhaps I can help them,” the kind old gentleman said as\\nhe took her on his knee and stroked the curly head with a paternal\\ntouch.\\n\\nSo Rosy told her latest grief, and never saw the smile that crept\\nabout the lips that asked in a tone of deep interest,--\\n\\n“Well, what do you mean to do to that unkind Cicely?”\\n\\n“For a minute I wanted to slap her back when she tried to spat my\\nhands. Then I ‘membered that Mamma said a kiss for a blow was a good\\nthing, so I picked up the beads and planned to do it; but Cis looked\\nSO cross I couldn’t. If I had a pretty necklace I’d go and give it\\nto her, and then maybe she’d love me better.”\\n\\n“My dear little missionary, you SHALL have beads to win the heart of\\nYOUR heathen, if that is all you need. See here; take anything you\\nlike, and give it with the kiss.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover pulled open a drawer in the desk and\\ndisplayed a delightful collection of pretty, quaint, and curious\\ntrinkets picked up in foreign lands, and kept for keepsakes, since\\nno little daughters of his own lived to wear them.\\n\\n“How perf’ly dorgeous!” cried Rosy, who often fell into baby talk\\nwhen excited; and plunging in her hands, she revelled for some\\nminutes in sandal-wood cases, carved ivory fans, silver bangles,\\nbarbaric brooches, and necklaces of coral, shells, amber, and golden\\ncoins, that jingled musically.\\n\\n“What SHALL I take for her?” cried the little maid, bewildered by\\nsuch a mine of wealth. “You pick out one, Mr. Thomas, that will\\nplease her so much, ‘cause you never send her anything, and she\\ndon’t like it,” said Rosy, fearing that her own taste was not to be\\ntrusted, as she liked the shells and shark’s teeth ornaments best.\\n\\n“No, I’ll give YOU one, and you shall do as you like about giving it\\nto her. This, now, is really valuable and pretty, and any young lady\\nwould like to wear it. It makes me think of you, my Button, for it\\nis like sunshine, and the word cut on the little heart means peace.”\\n\\nMr. Dover held up a string of amber beads with its carved amulet,\\nand swung it to and fro where the light shone through it till each\\nbead looked like a drop of golden wine.\\n\\n“Yes, that is lovely, and it smells nice, too. She will be so\\ns’prised and pleased; I’ll go and take it to her right away,” cried\\nRosy, forgetting to ask anything for herself, in her delight at this\\nfine gift for Cis.\\n\\nBut as she lifted her head after he had fastened the clasp about her\\nneck, something in his face recalled the look it wore when she first\\ncame in, and putting both hands upon his shoulders, she said in her\\nsweet little way,--\\n\\n“You’ve made my troubles go away, can’t I make yours? You are SO\\nkind to me, I’d love to help you if I could.”\\n\\n“You do, my child, more than you know; for when I get you in my arms\\nit seems as if one of my poor babies had come back to me, and for a\\nminute I forget the three little graves far away in India.”\\n\\n“Three!” cried Button, like a sad, soft echo; and she clung to the\\npoor man as if trying to fill the empty arms with the love and pity\\nthat over-flowed the childish soul in her small body.\\n\\nThis was the comfort Mr. Thomas wanted, and for a few moments he\\njust cradled her on his hungry heart, crooning a Hindostanee\\nlullaby, while a few slow tears came dropping down upon the yellow\\nhead, so like those hidden for years under the Indian flowers.\\nPresently he seemed to come back from the happy past to which the\\nold letters had carried him. He wiped his eyes, and Rosy’s also,\\nwith the big purple silk handkerchief, and pressing some very\\ngrateful kisses on the hot cheeks, said cheerfully again,--\\n\\n“God bless you, child, that’s done me good! But don’t let it sadden\\nyou, dear; forget all about it, and tell no one what a sentimental\\nold fool I am.”\\n\\n“I never truly will! Only when you feel sorry about the poor little\\nbabies, let me come and give you cuddlings. They always make people\\nfeel more better, and I love ‘em, and don’t get any now my dear\\npeople are away.”\\n\\nSo the two made a tender little plan to comfort each other when\\nhearts were heavy with longings for the absent, and parted at the\\nsmall gate, both much cheered, and faster friends than ever.\\n\\nRosy hastened in with her peace-offering, forgetful now of headache\\nor loneliness as she sat patiently in the wide entry window-seat\\nlistening till some sound in Cicely’s room should show that she was\\nawake. Before that happened, however, poor Button fell asleep\\nherself, lulled by the quiet of the house,--for every one was\\nnapping,--and dreamed that Mr. Dover stood waving a rainbow over\\nhis head, while several Indian gods and three little girls were\\ndancing round him, hand in hand, to the tune of “Ring around a\\nrosy.”\\n\\nA loud yawn roused her, and there was Cis peeping out of her door to\\nsee what time it was by the old-fashioned clock on the landing. Up\\nscrambled the child, feeling dizzy and heavy-eyed, but so eager to\\ngive pleasure that she lost no time in saying, as she swung the\\nnecklace in the sunshine,--\\n\\n“See! this is for you, if you like it more better than the\\nthunder-and-lightning marbles, as Cousin Penny calls the one you\\nwere going to wear.”\\n\\n“How lovely! Where DID you get it, child?” cried Cis, wide awake at\\nonce, as she ran to the glass to try the effect of the new ornament\\non her white neck.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Thomas gave it to me; but he said I could give it away\\nif I liked, and I want you to have it, ‘cause it’s ever so much\\nprettier than any you’ve got.”\\n\\n“That’s very kind of you, Chicken, but why not keep it yourself? You\\nlike nice things as well as I do,” said Cicely, much impressed by\\nthe value of the gift, for it was real amber, and the clasp of gold.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve talked with Mr. Thomas about missionarying a great deal,\\nand he told me how he made the savinges good by giving them beads,\\nand things to eat, and being patient and kind to them. So I thought\\nI’d play be a missionary, and call this house Africa, and try to\\nmake the people here behave more better,” answered Rosy, with such\\nengaging earnestness, as well as frankness, that Cis laughed, and\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“You impertinent monkey, to call us heathen and try to convert us!\\nHow do you expect to do it?”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m getting on pretty well, only you don’t CONVERT as quick as\\nsome of the savinges did. I’ll tell you about it;” and Button went\\non eagerly. “Cousin Penny is the good old one, but rather fussy and\\nslow, so I’m kind and patient, and now she loves me and lets me do\\nthings I like. She is my best one. Cousin Henny is my cannybel,\\n‘cause she eats so much, and I please HER by bringing nice things\\nand getting her cushions ready. You are my baddest one, who is cross\\nto me, and fights, and raps my head, and slaps my hands; so I\\nthought some beads would be nice for you, and I bringed these\\nbeauties. Mr. Thomas gave ‘em to me when I told him my trials.”\\n\\nCicely looked angry, amused, and ashamed, as she listened to the\\nfunny yet rather pathetic little play with which the lonely child\\nhad tried to cheer herself and win the hearts of those about her.\\nShe had the grace to blush, and offer back the necklace, saying in a\\nself-reproachful tone,--\\n\\n“Keep your beads, little missionary, I’ll be converted without them,\\nand try to be kinder to you. I AM a selfish wretch, but you shall\\nplay be my little sister, and not have to go to strangers for\\ncomfort in your trials any more. Come, kiss me, dear, and we’ll\\nbegin now.”\\n\\nRosy was in her arms at once, and clung there, saying with a face\\nall smiles,--\\n\\n“That’s what I wanted! I thought I’d make a good savinge of you if I\\ntried VERY hard. Please be kind to me just till Mamma comes back,\\nand I’ll be the best little sister that ever was.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you tell me all about it before?” asked Cicely,\\nsmoothing the tired head on her shoulder with a new gentleness; for\\nthis last innocent confession had touched her heart as well as her\\nconscience.\\n\\n“You never seemed to care about my plays, and always said, ‘Don’t\\nchatter, child; run away and take care of yourself.’ So I did; but\\nit was pretty dull, with only Tabby to tell secrets to and Bella to\\nkiss. Mr. Thomas said people over here didn’t like children very\\nwell, and I found they didn’t. HE does, dearly, so I went to him;\\nbut I like you now, you are so soft and kind to me.”\\n\\n“How hot your cheeks are! Come and let me cool them, and brush your\\nhair for tea,” said Cis, as she touched the child’s feverish skin,\\nand saw how heavy her eyes were.\\n\\n“I’m all burning up, and my head is SO funny. I don’t want any tea.\\nI want to lie on your sofa and go to sleep again. Can I?” asked\\nRosy, with a dizzy look about the room, and a shiver at the idea of\\neating.\\n\\n“Yes, dear, I’ll put on your little wrapper, and make you all\\ncomfortable, and bring you some ice-water, for your lips are very\\ndry.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Cicely bustled about the room, and soon had Rosy\\nnicely settled with her best cologne-bottle and a fan; then she\\nhastened down to report that something was wrong, with a fear in her\\nown heart that if any harm did come to the child it would be her\\nfault. Some days before Cicely had sent Button-Rose with a note to a\\nfriend’s house where she knew some of the younger children were ill.\\nSince then she had heard that it was scarlet fever; but though Rosy\\nhad waited some time for an answer to the note, and seen one of the\\ninvalids, Cis had never mentioned the fact, being ashamed to confess\\nher carelessness, hoping no harm was done. Now she felt that it HAD\\ncome, and went to tell gentle Cousin Penny with tears of vain\\nregret.\\n\\nGreat was the lamentation when the doctor, who was sent for in hot\\nhaste, pronounced it scarlet fever; and deep was the self-reproach\\nof the two older women for their blindness in not before remarking\\nthe languid air and want of appetite in the child. But Cicely was\\nfull of remorse; for every quick word, every rap of the hateful\\nthimble, every service accepted without thanks, weighed heavily on\\nher conscience now, as such things have an inconvenient way of doing\\nwhen it is too late to undo them. Every one was devoted to the\\nchild, even lazy Miss Henny gave up her naps to sit by her at all\\nhours, Miss Penny hovered over the little bed like a grandmother,\\nand Cicely refused to think of pleasure till the danger was over.\\n\\nFor soon Button-Rose was very ill, and the old house haunted by the\\ndreadful fear that death would rob them of the little creature who\\ngrew so precious when the thought of losing her made their hearts\\nstand still. How could they live without the sound of that sweet\\nvoice chirping about the house, the busy feet tripping up and down,\\nthe willing hands trying to help, the sunny face smiling at every\\none, and going away into corners to hide the tears that sometimes\\ncame to dim its brightness? What would comfort the absent mother for\\nsuch a loss as this, and how could they answer to the father for the\\ncarelessness that risked the child’s life for a girl’s errand? No\\none dared to think, and all prayed heartily for Rosy’s life, as they\\nwatched and waited by the little bed where she lay so patiently,\\ntill the fever grew high and she began to babble about many things.\\nHer childish trials were all told, her longings for Mamma, whose\\nplace no one could fill, her quaint little criticisms upon those\\nabout her, and her plans for making peace. These innocent\\nrevelations caused many tears, and wrought some changes in those who\\nheard; for Miss Penny quite forgot her infirmities to live in the\\nsick-room as the most experienced nurse and tenderest watcher. Miss\\nHenny cooked her daintiest gruel, brewed her coolest drinks, and\\nlost many pounds in weight by her indefatigable trotting up and down\\nto minister to the invalid’s least caprice. Cicely was kept away for\\nfear of infection, but HER penance was to wander about the great\\nhouse, more silent than ever now, to answer the inquiries and listen\\nto the sad forebodings of the neighbors, who came to offer help and\\nsympathy; for all loved little Button-Rose, and grieved to think of\\nany blight falling on the pretty blossom. To wile away the long\\nhours, Cicely fell to dusting the empty rooms, setting closets and\\ndrawers to rights, and keeping all fresh and clean, to the great\\nrelief of the old cousins, who felt that everything would go to\\ndestruction in their absence. She read and sewed now, having no\\nheart for jaunting about; and as she made the long neglected white\\npinafores, for Rosy, she thought much of the little girl who might\\nnever live to wear them.\\n\\nMeantime the fever took its course, and came at last to the fateful\\nday when a few hours would settle the question of life or death. The\\nhot flush died out of the cheeks that had lost their soft roundness\\nnow, the lips were parched, the half-shut eyes looked like sick\\nviolets, and all the pretty curls were tangled on the pillow. Rosy\\nno longer sung to Bella, talked of “three dear little girls” and Mr.\\nThomas, tigers and bangles, Cis and necklaces, hens and gates. She\\nceased to call for Mamma, asked no more why her “missionary man”\\n never came, and took no notice of the anxious old faces bending over\\nher. She lay in a stupor, and the doctor held the little wasted\\nhand, and tried to see the face of his watch with dim eyes as he\\ncounted the faint pulse, whispering solemnly,--\\n\\n“We can only hope and wait now. Sleep alone can save her.”\\n\\nAs the sisters sat, one on either side the narrow bed that day, and\\nCicely walked restlessly up and down the long hall below, where both\\ndoors stood open to let in the cool evening air, as the sun went\\ndown, a quick but quiet step came up the steps, and Mr. Dover walked\\nin without ringing. He had been away, and coming home an hour ago,\\nheard the sad news. Losing not a moment, he hurried to ask about his\\nlittle Button, and his face showed how great his love and fear were,\\nas he said in a broken whisper,--\\n\\n“Will she live? My mother never told me how serious it was, or I\\nshould have returned at once.”\\n\\n“We hope so, sir, but--” And there Cicely’s voice failed, as she hid\\nher face and sobbed.\\n\\n“My dear girl, don’t give way. Keep up your heart, hope, pray, will\\nthat the darling SHALL live, and that may do some good. We can’t let\\nher go! we won’t let her go! Let me see her; I know much of fevers\\nfar worse than this, and might be able to suggest something,” begged\\nMr. Dover, throwing down his hat, and waving an immense fan with\\nsuch an air of resolution and cheery good-will that tired Cis felt\\ncomforted at once, and led the way upstairs entirely forgetting the\\ngreat feud, as he did.\\n\\nAt the threshold of the door he paused, till the girl had whispered\\nhis name. Miss Penny, always a gentlewoman, rose at once and went\\nto meet him, but Miss Henny did not even seem to see him, for just\\nthen, as if dimly feeling that her friend was near, Rosy stirred,\\nand gave a long sigh.\\n\\nSilently the three stood and looked at the beloved little creature\\nlying there in the mysterious shadow of death, and they so helpless\\nto keep her if the hour for departure had come.\\n\\n“God help us!” sighed pious Miss Penny, folding her old hands, as if\\nthey did that often now.\\n\\n“Drifting away, I fear;” and Miss Henny’s plump face looked almost\\nbeautiful, with the tears on it, as she leaned nearer to listen to\\nthe faint breath at the child’s lips.\\n\\n“No; we will keep her, please the Lord! If we can make her sleep\\nquietly for the next few hours she is safe. Let me try. Fan slowly\\nwith this, Miss Henrietta, and you, dear lady, pray that the\\nprecious little life may be given us.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover gave the great fan to Miss Henny, took the\\nsmall cold hands in his, and sitting on the bedside held them close\\nin his large warm ones, as if trying to pour life and strength into\\nthe frail body, as his eyes, fixed on the half-opened ones, seemed\\nto call back the innocent soul hovering on the threshold of its\\nprison, like the butterfly poised upon the chrysalis before it soars\\naway.\\n\\nMiss Penny knelt down near by, and laying her white head on the\\nother pillow, again besought God to spare this treasure to the\\nfather and mother over the sea. How long they remained so none of\\nthem ever knew, silent and motionless but for the slow waving of the\\nnoiseless fan, which went to and fro like the wing of a great white\\nbird, as if Miss Henny’s stout arm could never tire. Miss Penny was\\nso still she seemed to be asleep. Mr. Dover never stirred, but grew\\npaler as the minutes passed; and Cicely, creeping now and then to\\nlook in and steal away, saw strange power in the black eyes that\\nseemed to hold the fluttering spirit of the little child by the love\\nand longing that made them both tender and commanding.\\n\\nA level ray of sunlight stole through the curtain at last and turned\\nthe tangles of bright hair to pure gold. Miss Henny rose to shut it\\nout, and as if her movement broke the spell, Rosy took a long full\\nbreath, turned on the pillow, and putting one hand under her cheek,\\nseemed to fall asleep as naturally as she used to do when well. Miss\\nPenny looked up, touched the child’s forehead, and whispered, with a\\nlook of gratitude as bright as if the sunshine had touched her\\nalso,--\\n\\n“It is moist! this is real sleep! Oh, my baby! oh, my baby!” And the\\nold head went down again with a stifled sob, for her experienced eye\\ntold her that the danger was passing by and Rosy would live.\\n\\n“The prayers of the righteous avail much,” murmured Mr. Dover,\\nturning to the other lady, who stood beside her sister looking down\\nat the little figure now lying so restfully between them.\\n\\n“How can we thank you?” she whispered, offering her hand, with the\\nsmile which had once made her pretty, and still touched the old face\\nwith something better than beauty.\\n\\nMr. Dover took the hand and answered, with an eloquent look at the\\nchild,--\\n\\n“Let not the sun go down upon our wrath. Forgive me and be friends\\nagain, for her sake.”\\n\\n“I will!” And the plump hands gave the thin ones a hearty shake as\\nthe great feud ended forever over the bed of the little peacemaker\\nwhose childish play had turned to happy earnest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR\\n\\n\\n“Here’s your breakfast, miss. I hope it’s right. Your mother showed\\nme how to fix it, and said I’d find a cup up here.”\\n\\n“Take that blue one. I have not much appetite, and can’t eat if\\nthings are not nice and pretty. I like the flowers. I’ve been\\nlonging for some ever since I saw them last night.”\\n\\nThe first speaker was a red-haired, freckle-faced girl, in a brown\\ncalico dress and white apron, with a tray in her hands and an air of\\ntimid hospitality in her manner; the second a pale, pretty creature,\\nin a white wrapper and blue net, sitting in a large chair, looking\\nabout her with the languid interest of an invalid in a new place.\\nHer eyes brightened as they fell upon a glass of rosy laurel and\\ndelicate maidenhair fern that stood among the toast and eggs,\\nstrawberries and cream, on the tray.\\n\\n“Our laurel is jest in blow, and I’m real glad you come in time to\\nsee it. I’ll bring you a lot, as soon’s ever I get time to go for\\nit.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, the plain girl replaced the ugly crockery cup and\\nsaucer with the pretty china ones pointed out to her, arranged the\\ndishes, and waited to see if anything else was needed.\\n\\n“What is your name, please?” asked the pretty girl, refreshing\\nherself with a draught of new milk.\\n\\n“Rebecca. Mother thought I’d better wait on you; the little girls\\nare so noisy and apt to forget. Wouldn’t you like a piller to your\\nback? you look so kind of feeble seems as if you wanted to be\\npropped up a mite.”\\n\\nThere was so much compassion and good-will in the face and voice,\\nthat Emily accepted the offer, and let Rebecca arrange a cushion\\nbehind her; then, while the one ate daintily, and the other stirred\\nabout an inner room, the talk went on,--for two girls are seldom\\nlong silent when together.\\n\\n“I think the air is going to suit me, for I slept all night and\\nnever woke till Mamma had been up ever so long and got things all\\nnicely settled,” said Emily, graciously, when the fresh strawberries\\nhad been enjoyed, and the bread and butter began to vanish.\\n\\n“I’m real glad you like it; most folks do, if they don’t mind it\\nbeing plain and quiet up here. It’s gayer down at the hotel, but the\\nair ain’t half so good, and delicate folks generally like our old\\nplace best,” answered Becky, as she tossed over a mattress and shook\\nout the sheet with a brisk, capable air pleasant to see.\\n\\n“I wanted to go to the hotel, but the doctor said it would be too\\nnoisy for me, so Mamma was glad to find rooms here. I didn’t think a\\nfarm-house COULD be so pleasant. That view is perfectly splendid!”\\n and Emily sat up to gaze delightedly out of the window, below which\\nspread the wide intervale, through which the river ran with\\nhay-fields on either side, while along the green slopes of the hills\\nlay farm-houses with garden plots, and big barns waiting for the\\nharvest; and beyond, the rocky, wooded pastures dotted with cattle\\nand musical with cow-bells, brooks, and birds.\\n\\nA balmy wind kissed a little color into the pale cheeks, the\\nlistless eyes brightened as they looked, and the fretful lines\\nvanished from lips that smiled involuntarily at the sweet welcome\\nNature gave the city child come to rest and play and grow gay and\\nrosy in her green lap.\\n\\nBecky watched her with interest, and was glad to see how soon the\\nnew-comer felt the charm of the place, for the girl loved her\\nmountain home, and thought the old farm-house the loveliest spot in\\nthe world.\\n\\n“When you get stronger I can show you lots of nice views round here.\\nThere’s a woodsy place behind the house that’s just lovely. Down by\\nthe laurel bushes is MY favorite spot, and among the rocks is a cave\\nwhere I keep things handy when I get a resting-spell now and then,\\nand want to be quiet. Can’t get much at home, when there’s boarders\\nand five children round in vacation time.”\\n\\nBecky laughed as she spoke, and there was a sweet motherly look in\\nher plain face, as she glanced at the three little red heads bobbing\\nabout the door-yard below, where hens cackled, a pet lamb fed, and\\nthe old white dog lay blinking in the sun.\\n\\n“I like children; we have none at home, and Mamma makes such a baby\\nof me I’m almost ashamed sometimes. I want her to have a good rest\\nnow, for she has taken care of me all winter and needs it. You shall\\nbe my nurse, if I need one; but I hope to be so well soon that I can\\nsee to myself. It’s so tiresome to be ill!” and Emily sighed as she\\nleaned back among her pillows, with a glance at the little glass\\nwhich showed her a thin face and shorn head.\\n\\n“It must be! I never was sick, but I have taken care of sick folks,\\nand have a sight of sympathy for ‘em. Mother says I make a pretty\\ngood nurse, being strong and quiet,” answered Becky, plumping up\\npillows and folding towels with a gentle despatch which was very\\ngrateful to the invalid, who had dreaded a noisy, awkward\\nserving-maid.\\n\\n“Never ill! how nice that must be! I’m always having colds and\\nheadaches, and fusses of some kind. What do you do to keep well,\\nRebecca?” asked Emily, watching her with interest, as she came in to\\nremove the tray.\\n\\n“Nothing but work; I haven’t time to be sick, and when I’m tuckered\\nout, I go and rest over yonder. Then I’m all right, and buckle to\\nagain, as smart as ever;” and every freckle in Becky’s rosy face\\nseemed to shine with cheerful strength and courage.\\n\\n“I’m ‘tuckered out’ doing nothing,” said Emily, amused with the new\\nexpression, and eager to try a remedy which showed such fine results\\nin this case. “I shall visit your pet places and do a little work as\\nsoon as I am able, and see if it won’t set me up. Now I can only\\ndawdle, doze, and read a little. Will you please put those books\\nhere on the table? I shall want them by-and-by.”\\n\\nEmily pointed to a pile of blue and gold volumes lying on a trunk,\\nand Becky dusted her hands as she took them up with an air of\\nreverence, for she read on the backs of the volumes names which made\\nher eyes sparkle.\\n\\n“Do you care for poetry?” asked Emily, surprised at the girl’s look\\nand manner.\\n\\n“Guess I do! don’t get much except the pieces I cut out of papers,\\nbut I love ‘em, and stick ‘em in an old ledger, and keep it down in\\nmy cubby among the rocks. I do love THAT man’s pieces. They seem to\\ngo right to the spot somehow;” and Becky smiled at the name of\\nWhittier as if the sweetest of our poets was a dear old friend of\\nhers.\\n\\n“I like Tennyson better. Do you know him?” asked Emily, with a\\nsuperior air, for the idea of this farmer’s daughter knowing\\nanything about poetry amused her.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve got a number of his pieces in my book, and I’m fond of\\n‘em. But this man makes things so kind of true and natural I feel at\\nhome with HIM. And this one I’ve longed to read, though I guess I\\ncan’t understand much of it. His ‘Bumble Bee’ was just lovely; with\\nthe grass and columbines and the yellow breeches of the bee. I’m\\nnever tired of that;” and Becky’s face woke up into something like\\nbeauty as she glanced hungrily at the Emerson while she dusted the\\ndelicate cover that hid the treasures she coveted.\\n\\n“I don’t care much for him, but Mamma does. I like romantic poems,\\nand ballads, and songs; don’t like descriptions of clouds and\\nfields, and bees, and farmers,” said Emily, showing plainly that\\neven Emerson’s simplest poems were far above her comprehension as\\nyet, because she loved sentiment more than Nature.\\n\\n“I do, because I know ‘em better than love and the romantic stuff\\nmost poetry tells about. But I don’t pretend to judge, I’m glad of\\nanything I can get. Now if you don’t want me I’ll pick up my dishes\\nand go to work.”\\n\\nWith that Becky went away, leaving Emily to rest and dream with her\\neyes on the landscape which was giving her better poetry than any\\nher books held. She told her mother about the odd girl, and was sure\\nshe would be amusing if she did not forget her place and try to be\\nfriends.\\n\\n“She is a good creature, my dear, her mother’s main stay, and works\\nbeyond her strength, I am sure. Be kind to the poor girl, and put a\\nlittle pleasure into her life if you can,” answered Mrs. Spenser, as\\nshe moved about, settling comforts and luxuries for her invalid.\\n\\n“I shall HAVE to talk to her, as there is no other person of my age\\nin the house. How are the school marms? shall you get on with them,\\nMamma? It will be so lonely here for us both, if we don’t make\\nfriends with some one.”\\n\\n“Most intelligent and amiable women all three, and we shall have\\npleasant times together, I am sure. You may safely cultivate Becky;\\nMrs. Taylor told me she was a remarkably bright girl, though she may\\nnot look it.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see. But I do hate freckles and big red hands, and round\\nshoulders. She can’t help it, I suppose, but ugly things fret me.”\\n\\n“Remember that she has no time to be pretty, and be glad she is so\\nneat and willing. Shall we read, dear? I’m ready now.”\\n\\nEmily consented, and listened for an hour or two while the pleasant\\nvoice beside her conjured away all her vapors with some of Mrs.\\nEwing’s charming tales.\\n\\n“The grass is dry now, and I want to stroll on that green lawn\\nbefore lunch. You rest, Mamma dear, and let me make discoveries all\\nalone,” proposed Emily, when the sun shone warmly, and the instinct\\nof all young creatures for air and motion called her out.\\n\\nSo, with her hat and wrap, and book and parasol, she set forth to\\nexplore the new land in which she found herself.\\n\\nDown the wide, creaking stairs and out upon the door-stone she went,\\npausing there for a moment to decide where first to go. The sound of\\nsome one singing in the rear of the house led her in that direction,\\nand turning the corner she made her first pleasant discovery. A hill\\nrose steeply behind the farm-house, and leaning from the bank was an\\nold apple-tree, shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks\\nand dropped into a mossy trough below. Up the tree had grown a wild\\ngrape-vine, making a green canopy over the great log which served as\\na seat, and some one had planted maidenhair ferns about both seat\\nand spring to flourish beautifully in the damp, shady spot.\\n\\n“Oh, how pretty! I’ll go and sit there. It looks clean, and I can\\nsee what is going on in that big kitchen, and hear the singing. I\\nsuppose it’s Becky’s little sisters by the racket.”\\n\\nEmily established herself on the lichen-covered log with her feet\\nupon a stone, and sat enjoying the musical tinkle of the water, with\\nher eyes on the delicate ferns stirring in the wind, and the lively\\njingle of the multiplication-table chanted by childish voices in her\\near.\\n\\nPresently two little girls with a great pan of beans came to do\\ntheir work on the back doorstep, a third was seen washing dishes at\\na window, and Becky’s brown-spotted gown flew about the kitchen as\\nif a very energetic girl wore it. A woman’s voice was heard giving\\ndirections, as the speaker was evidently picking chickens somewhere\\nout of sight.\\n\\nA little of the talk reached Emily and both amused and annoyed her,\\nfor it proved that the country people were not as stupid as they\\nlooked.\\n\\n“Oh, well, we mustn’t mind if she IS notional and kind of wearing;\\nshe’s been sick, and it will take time to get rid of her fretty\\nways. Jest be pleasant, and take no notice, and that nice mother of\\nhers will make it all right,” said the woman’s voice.\\n\\n“How anybody with every mortal thing to be happy with CAN be\\nout-of-sorts passes me. She fussed about every piller, chair, trunk,\\nand mite of food last night, and kept that poor tired lady trotting\\ntill I was provoked. She’s right pleasant this morning though, and\\nas pretty as a picture in her ruffled gown and that blue thing on\\nher head,” answered Becky from the pantry, as she rattled out the\\npie-board, little dreaming who sat hidden behind the grape-vine\\nfestoons that veiled the corner by the spring.\\n\\n“Well, she’s got redder hair ‘n’ we have, so she needn’t be so grand\\nand try to hide it with blue nets,” added one little voice.\\n\\n“Yes, and it’s ever so much shorter ‘n’ ours, and curls all over her\\nhead like Daisy’s wool. I should think such a big girl would feel\\nreal ashamed without no braids,” said the other child, proudly\\nsurveying the tawny mane that hung over her shoulders,--for like\\nmost red-haired people all the children were blessed with luxuriant\\ncrops of every shade from golden auburn to regular carrots.\\n\\n“I think it’s lovely. Suppose it had to be cut off when she had the\\nfever. Wish I could get rid of my mop, it’s such a bother;” and\\nBecky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that made her\\nhead look very like a copper kettle.\\n\\n“Now fly round, deary, and get them pies ready. I’ll have these\\nfowls on in a minute, and then go to my butter. You run off and see\\nif you can’t find some wild strawberries for the poor girl, soon’s\\never you are through with them beans, children. We must kind of\\npamper her up for a spell till her appetite comes back,” said the\\nmother.\\n\\nHere the chat ended, and soon the little girls were gone, leaving\\nBecky alone rolling out pie-crust before the pantry window. As she\\nworked her lips moved, and Emily, still peeping through the leaves,\\nwondered what she was saying, for a low murmur rose and fell,\\nemphasized now and then with a thump of the rolling-pin.\\n\\n“I mean to go and find out. If I stand on that wash-bench I can look\\nin and see her work. I’ll show them all that _I_‘m NOT ‘fussy,’ and\\ncan be ‘right pleasant’ if I like.”\\n\\nWith this wise resolution Emily went down the little path, and after\\npausing to examine the churn set out to dry, and the row of pans\\nshining on a neighboring shelf, made her way to the window, mounted\\nthe bench while Becky’s back was turned, and pushing away the\\nmorning-glory vines and scarlet beans that ran up on either side\\npeeped in with such a smiling face that the crossest cook could not\\nhave frowned on her as an intruder.\\n\\n“May I see you work? I can’t eat pies, but I like to watch people\\nmake them. Do you mind?”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I’d ask you to come in, but it’s dreadful hot here, and\\nnot much room,” answered Becky, crimping round the pastry before she\\npoured in the custard. “I’m going to make a nice little pudding for\\nyou; your mother said you liked ‘em; or would you rather have\\nwhipped cream with a mite of jelly in it?” asked Becky, anxious to\\nsuit her new boarder.\\n\\n“Whichever is easiest to make. I don’t care what I eat. Do tell me\\nwhat you were saying. It sounded like poetry,” said Emily, leaning\\nboth elbows on the wide ledge with a pale pink morning-glory kissing\\nher cheek, and a savory odor reaching her nose.\\n\\n“Oh, I was mumbling some verses. I often do when I work, it sort of\\nhelps me along; but it must sound dreadfully silly,” and Becky\\nblushed as if caught in some serious fault.\\n\\n“I do it, and it’s a great comfort when I lie awake. I should think\\nyou WOULD want something to help you along, you work so hard. Do you\\nlike it, Becky?”\\n\\nThe familiar name, the kind tone, made the plain face brighten with\\npleasure as its owner said, while she carefully filled a pretty bowl\\nwith a golden mixture rich with fresh eggs and country milk--\\n\\n“No, I don’t, but I ought to. Mother isn’t as strong as she used to\\nbe, and there’s a sight to do, and the children to be brought up,\\nand the mortgage to be paid off; so if _I_ don’t fly round, who\\nwill? We are doing real well now, for Mr. Walker manages the farm\\nand gives us our share, so our living is all right; then boarders in\\nsummer and my school in winter helps a deal, and every year the boys\\ncan do more, so I’d be a real sinner to complain if I do have to\\nstep lively all day.”\\n\\nBecky smiled as she spoke, and straightened her bent shoulders as if\\nsettling her burden for another trudge along the path of duty.\\n\\n“Do you keep school? Why, how old are you, Becky?” asked Emily, much\\nimpressed by this new discovery.\\n\\n“I’m eighteen. I took the place of a teacher who got sick last fall,\\nand I kept school all winter. Folks seemed to like me, and I’m going\\nto have the same place this year. I’m so glad, for I needn’t go away\\nand the pay is pretty good, as the school is large and the children\\ndo well. You can see the school-house down the valley, that red\\nbrick one where the roads meet;” and Becky pointed a floury finger,\\nwith an air of pride that was pleasant to see.\\n\\nEmily glanced at the little red house where the sun shone hotly in\\nsummer, and all the winds of heaven must rage wildly in winter time,\\nfor it stood, as country schools usually do, in the barest, most\\nuninviting spot for miles around.\\n\\n“Isn’t it awful down there in winter?” she asked, with a shiver at\\nthe idea of spending days shut up in that forlorn place, with a\\ncrowd of rough country children.\\n\\n“Pretty cold, but we have plenty of wood, and we are used to snow\\nand gales up here. We often coast down, the whole lot of us, and\\nthat is great fun. We take our dinners and have games noon-spells,\\nand so we get on first rate; some of my boys are big fellows, older\\nthan I am; they clear the roads and make the fire and look after us,\\nand we are real happy together.”\\n\\nEmily found it so impossible to imagine happiness under such\\ncircumstances that she changed the subject by asking in a tone which\\nhad unconsciously grown more respectful since this last revelation\\nof Becky’s abilities,--\\n\\n“If you do so well here, why don’t you try for a larger school in a\\nbetter place?”\\n\\n“Oh, I couldn’t leave mother yet; I hope to some day, when the girls\\nare older, and the boys able to get on alone. But I can’t go now,\\nfor there’s a sight of things to do, and mother is always laid up\\nwith rheumatism in cold weather. So much butter-making down cellar\\nis bad for her; but she won’t let me do that in summer, so I take\\ncare of her in winter. I can see to things night and morning, and\\nthrough the day she’s quiet, and sits piecing carpet-rags and\\nresting up for next spring. We made and wove all the carpets in the\\nhouse, except the parlor one. Mrs. Taylor gave us that, and the\\ncurtains, and the easy-chair. Mother takes a sight of comfort in\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor is the lady who first came to board here, and told us\\nand others about it,” said Emily.\\n\\n“Yes, and she’s the kindest lady in the world! I’ll tell you all\\nabout her some day, it’s real interesting; now I must see to my\\npies, and get the vegetables on,” answered Becky, glancing at the\\ngay clock in the kitchen with an anxious look.\\n\\n“Then I won’t waste any more of your precious time. May I sit in\\nthat pretty place; or is it your private bower?” asked Emily, as she\\ndismounted from the wash-bench.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed you may. That’s mother’s resting-place when work is\\ndone. Father made the spring long ago, and I put the ferns there.\\nShe can’t go rambling round, and she likes pretty things, so we\\nfixed it up for her, and she takes comfort there nights.”\\n\\nBecky bustled off to the oven with her pies, and Emily roamed away\\nto the big barn to lie on the hay, enjoying the view down the\\nvalley, as she thought over what she had seen and heard, and very\\nnaturally contrasted her own luxurious and tenderly guarded life\\nwith this other girl’s, so hard and dull and narrow. Working all\\nsummer and teaching all winter in that dismal little school-house,\\nwith no change but home cares and carpet-weaving! It looked horrible\\nto pleasure-loving Emily, who led the happy, care-free life of\\ngirls of her class, with pleasures of all sorts, and a future of\\nstill greater luxury, variety, and happiness, opening brightly\\nbefore her.\\n\\nIt worried her to think of any one being contented with such a\\nmeagre share of the good things of life, when she was unsatisfied in\\nspite of the rich store showered upon her. She could not understand\\nit, and fell asleep wishing every one could be comfortable,--it was\\nso annoying to see them grubbing in kitchens, teaching in bleak\\nschool-houses among snow-drifts, and wearing ugly calico gowns.\\n\\nA week or two of quiet, country fare and the bracing mountain air\\nworked wonders for the invalid, and every one rejoiced to see the\\npale cheeks begin to grow round and rosy, the languid eyes to\\nbrighten, and the feeble girl who used to lie on her sofa half the\\nday now go walking about with her alpenstock, eager to explore all\\nthe pretty nooks among the hills. Her mother blessed Mrs. Taylor for\\nsuggesting this wholesome place. The tired “school marms,” as Emily\\ncalled the three young women who were their fellow-boarders,\\ncongratulated her as well as themselves on the daily improvement in\\nstrength and spirits all felt; and Becky exulted in the marvellous\\neffects of her native air, aided by mother’s good cookery and the\\ncheerful society of the children, whom the good girl considered the\\nmost remarkable and lovable youngsters in the world.\\n\\nEmily felt like the queen of this little kingdom, and was regarded\\nas such by every one, for with returning health she lost her fretful\\nways, and living with simple people, soon forgot her girlish airs\\nand vanities, becoming very sweet and friendly with all about her.\\nThe children considered her a sort of good fairy who could grant\\nwishes with magical skill, as various gifts plainly proved. The boys\\nwere her devoted servants, ready to run errands, “hitch up” and take\\nher to drive at any hour, or listen in mute delight when she sang to\\nher guitar in the summer twilight.\\n\\nBut to Becky she was a special godsend and comfort, for before the\\nfirst month had gone they were good friends, and Emily had made a\\ndiscovery which filled her head with brilliant plans for Becky’s\\nfuture, in spite of her mother’s warnings, and the sensible\\ngirl’s own reluctance to be dazzled by enthusiastic prophecies and\\ndreams.\\n\\nIt came about in this way. Some three weeks after the two girls met,\\nEmily went one evening to their favorite trysting-place,--Becky’s\\nbower among the laurels. It was a pretty nook in the shadow of a\\ngreat gray bowlder near the head of the green valley which ran down\\nto spread into the wide intervale below. A brook went babbling among\\nthe stones and grass and sweet-ferns, while all the slope was rosy\\nwith laurel-flowers in their times, as the sturdy bushes grew\\nthickly on the hill-side, down the valley, and among the woods that\\nmade a rich background for these pink and white bouquets arranged\\nwith Nature’s own careless grace.\\n\\nEmily liked this spot, and ever since she had been strong enough to\\nreach it, loved to climb up and sit there with book and work,\\nenjoying the lovely panorama before her. Floating mists often gave\\nher a constant succession of pretty pictures; now a sunny glimpse of\\nthe distant lake, then the church spire peeping above the hill, or a\\nflock of sheep feeding in the meadow, a gay procession of young\\npilgrims winding up the mountain, or a black cloud heavy with a\\ncoming storm, welcome because of the glorious rainbow and its shadow\\nwhich would close the pageant.\\n\\nUnconsciously the girl grew to feel not only the beauty but the\\nvalue of these quiet hours, to find a new peace, refreshment, and\\nhappiness, bubbling up in her heart as naturally as the brook gushed\\nout among the mossy rocks, and went singing away through hayfields\\nand gardens, and by dusty roads, till it met the river and rolled on\\nto the sea. Something dimly stirred in her, and the healing spirit\\nthat haunts such spots did its sweet ministering till the innocent\\nsoul began to see that life was not perfect without labor as well as\\nlove, duty as well as happiness, and that true contentment came from\\nwithin, not from without.\\n\\nOn the evening we speak of, she went to wait for Becky, who would\\njoin her as soon as the after-supper chores were done. In the little\\ncave which held a few books, a dipper, and a birch-bark basket for\\nberries, Emily kept a sketching block and a box of pencils, and\\noften amused herself by trying to catch some of the lovely scenes\\nbefore her. These efforts usually ended in a humbler attempt, and a\\ngood study of an oak-tree, a bit of rock, or a clump of ferns was\\nthe result. This evening the sunset was so beautiful she could not\\ndraw, and remembering that somewhere in Becky’s scrap-book there was\\na fine description of such an hour by some poet, she pulled out the\\nshabby old volume, and began to turn over the leaves.\\n\\nShe had never cared to look at it but once, having read all the best\\nof its contents in more attractive volumes, so Becky kept it tucked\\naway in the farther corner of her rustic closet, and evidently\\nthought it a safe place to conceal a certain little secret which\\nEmily now discovered. As she turned the stiff pages filled with all\\nsorts of verses, good, bad, and indifferent, a sheet of paper\\nappeared on which was scribbled these lines in school-girl\\nhandwriting:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN--LAUREL\\n\\n\\n  My bonnie flower, with truest joy\\n    Thy welcome face I see,\\n  The world grows brighter to my eyes,\\n    And summer comes with thee.\\n  My solitude now finds a friend,\\n    And after each hard day,\\n  I in my mountain garden walk,\\n    To rest, or sing, or pray.\\n\\n  All down the rocky slope is spread\\n    Thy veil of rosy snow,\\n  And in the valley by the brook,\\n    Thy deeper blossoms grow.\\n  The barren wilderness grows fair,\\n    Such beauty dost thou give;\\n  And human eyes and Nature’s heart\\n    Rejoice that thou dost live.\\n\\n  Each year I wait thy coming, dear,\\n    Each year I love thee more,\\n  For life grows hard, and much I need\\n    Thy honey for my store.\\n  So, like a hungry bee, I sip\\n    Sweet lessons from thy cup,\\n  And sitting at a flower’s feet,\\n    My soul learns to look up.\\n\\n  No laurels shall I ever win,\\n     No splendid blossoms bear,\\n  But gratefully receive and use\\n   God’s blessed sun and air;\\n  And, blooming where my lot is cast,\\n   Grow happy and content,\\n  Making some barren spot more fair,\\n   For a humble life well spent.\\n\\n“She wrote it herself! I can’t believe it!” said Emily, as she put\\ndown the paper, looking rather startled, for she DID believe it, and\\nfelt as if she had suddenly looked into a fellow-creature’s heart.\\n“I thought her just an ordinary girl, and here she is a poet,\\nwriting verses that make me want to cry! I don’t suppose they ARE\\nvery good, but they seem to come right out of her heart, and touch\\nme with the longing and the patience or the piety in them. Well, I\\nAM surprised!” and Emily read the lines again, seeing the faults\\nmore plainly than before, but still feeling that the girl put\\nherself into them, vainly trying to express what the wild flower was\\nto her in the loneliness which comes to those who have a little\\nspark of the divine fire burning in their souls.\\n\\n“Shall I tell her I’ve found it out? I must! and see if I can’t get\\nher verses printed. Of course she has more tucked away somewhere.\\nThat is what she hums to herself when she’s at work, and won’t tell\\nme about when I ask. Sly thing! to be so bashful and hide her gift.\\nI’ll tease her a bit and see what she says. Oh dear, I wish _I_\\ncould do it! Perhaps she’ll be famous some day, and then I’ll have\\nthe glory of discovering her.”\\n\\nWith that consolation Emily turned over the pages of the ledger and\\nfound several more bits of verse, some very good for an untaught\\ngirl, others very faulty, but all having a certain strength of\\nfeeling and simplicity of language unusual in the effusions of young\\nmaidens at the sentimental age.\\n\\nEmily had a girlish admiration for talent of any kind, and being\\nfond of poetry, was especially pleased to find that her humble\\nfriend possessed the power of writing it. Of course she exaggerated\\nBecky’s talent, and as she waited for her, felt sure that she had\\ndiscovered a feminine Burns among the New Hampshire hills, for all\\nthe verses were about natural and homely objects, touched into\\nbeauty by sweet words or tender sentiment. She had time to build a\\nsplendid castle in the air and settle Becky in it with a crown of\\nglory on her head, before the quiet figure in a faded sunbonnet came\\nslowly up the slope with the glow of sunset on a tired but tranquil\\nface.\\n\\n“Sit here and have a good rest, while I talk to you,” said Emily,\\neager to act the somewhat dramatic scene she had planned. Becky sunk\\nupon the red cushion prepared for her, and sat looking down at the\\nanimated speaker, as Emily, perched on a mossy stone before her,\\nbegan the performance.\\n\\n“Becky, did you ever hear of the Goodale children? They lived in the\\ncountry and wrote poetry and grew to be famous.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve read their poems and like ‘em very much. Do you know\\n‘em?” and Becky looked interested at once.\\n\\n“No, but I once met a girl who was something like them, only she\\ndidn’t have such an easy time as they did, with a father to help,\\nand a nice Sky-farm, and good luck generally. I’ve tried to write\\nverses myself, but I always get into a muddle, and give it up. This\\nmakes me interested in other girls who CAN do it, and I want to help\\nmy friend. I’m SURE she has talent, and I’d so like to give her a\\nlift in some way. Let me read you a piece of hers and see what you\\nthink of it.”\\n\\n“Do!” and Beck threw off the sunbonnet, folded her hands round her\\nknees, and composed herself to listen with such perfect\\nunconsciousness of what was coming that Emily both laughed at the\\njoke and blushed at the liberty she felt she was taking with the\\npoor girl’s carefully hidden secret.\\n\\nBecky was sure now that Emily was going to read something of her own\\nafter this artful introduction, and began to smile as the paper was\\nproduced and the first four lines read in a tone that was half\\ntimid, half triumphant. Then with a cry she seized and crumpled up\\nthe paper, exclaiming almost fiercely,--\\n\\n“It’s mine! Where did you get it? How dar’st you touch it?”\\n\\nEmily fell upon her knees with a face and voice so full of\\npenitence, pleasure, sympathy, and satisfaction, that Becky’s wrath\\nwas appeased before her friend’s explanation ended with these\\nsoothing and delightful words,--\\n\\n“That’s all, dear, and I beg your pardon. But I’m sure you will be\\nfamous if you keep on, and I shall yet see a volume of poems by\\nRebecca Moore of Rocky Nook, New Hampshire.”\\n\\nBecky hid her face as if shame, surprise, wonder, and joy filled her\\nheart too full and made a few happy tears drop on the hands so worn\\nwith hard work, when they ached to be holding a pen and trying to\\nrecord the fancies that sung in her brain as ceaselessly as the soft\\nsough of the pines or the ripple of the brook murmured in her ear\\nwhen she sat here alone. She could not express the vague longings\\nthat stirred in her soul; she could only feel and dimly strive to\\nunderstand and utter them, with no thought of fame or fortune,--for\\nshe was a humble creature, and never knew that the hardships of her\\nlife were pressing out the virtues of her nature as the tread of\\ncareless feet crush the sweet perfume from wild herbs.\\n\\nPresently she looked up, deeply touched by Emily’s words and\\ncaresses, and her blue eyes shone like stars as her face beamed with\\nsomething finer than mere beauty, for the secrets of her innocent\\nheart were known to this friend now, and it was very sweet to accept\\nthe first draught of confidence and praise.\\n\\n“I don’t mind much, but I was scared for a minute. No one knows but\\nMother, and she laughs at me, though she don’t care if it makes me\\nhappy. I’m glad you like my scribbling, but really I never think or\\nhope of being anybody. I couldn’t, you know! but it’s real nice to\\nhave you say I MIGHT and to make believe for a while.”\\n\\n“But why not, Becky? The Goodale girls did, and half the poets in\\nthe world were poor, ignorant people at first, you know. It only\\nneeds time and help, and the gift will grow, and people see it; and\\nthen the glory and the money will come,” cried Emily, quite carried\\naway by her own enthusiasm and good-will.\\n\\n“Could I get any money by these things?” asked Becky, looking at the\\ncrumpled paper lying under a laurel-bush.\\n\\n“Of course you could, dear! Let me have some of them, and I’ll show\\nyou that I know good poetry when I see it. You will believe if some\\nbank-bills come with the paper the verses appear in, I hope?”\\n\\nBlind to any harm she might do by exciting vain hopes in her\\neagerness to cheer and help, Emily made this rash proposal in all\\ngood faith, meaning to pay for the verses herself if no editor was\\nfound to accept them.\\n\\nBecky looked half bewildered by this brilliant prospect, and took a\\nlong breath, as if some hand had lifted a heavy burden a little way\\nfrom her weary back, for stronger than ambition for herself was love\\nfor her family, and the thought of help for them was sweeter than\\nany dream of fame.\\n\\n“Yes, I would! oh, if I only COULD, I’d be the happiest girl in the\\nworld! But I can’t believe it, Emily. I heard Mrs. Taylor say that\\nonly the VERY BEST poetry paid, and mine is poor stuff, I know well\\nenough.”\\n\\n“Of course it needs polishing and practice and all that; but I’m\\nsure it is oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle we see in\\nthe papers, and I KNOW that some of those pieces ARE paid for,\\nbecause I have a friend who is in a newspaper office, and he told me\\nso. Yours are quaint and simple and some very original. I’m sure\\nthat ballad of the old house is lovely, and I want to send it to\\nWhittier. Mamma knows him; it’s the sort he likes, and he is so kind\\nto every one, he will criticise it, and be interested when she tells\\nhim about you. Do let me!”\\n\\n“I never could in the world! It would be so bold, Mother would think\\nI was crazy. I love Mr. Whittier, but I wouldn’t dar’st to show him\\nmy nonsense, though reading his beautiful poetry helps me ever so\\nmuch.”\\n\\nBecky looked and spoke as if her breath had been taken away by this\\naudacious proposal; and yet a sudden delicious hope sprung up in her\\nheart that there might, perhaps, be a spark of real virtue in the\\nlittle fire which burned within her, warming and brightening her\\ndull life.\\n\\n“Let us ask Mamma; she will tell us what is best to do first, for\\nshe knows all sorts of literary people, and won’t say any more than\\nyou want her to. I’m bent on having my way, Becky, and the more\\nmodest you are, the surer I am that you are a genius. Real geniuses\\nalways ARE shy; so you just make up your mind to give me the best of\\nyour pieces, and let me prove that I’m right.”\\n\\nIt was impossible to resist such persuasive words, and Becky soon\\nyielded to the little siren who was luring her out of her safe,\\nsmall pool into the deeper water that looks so blue and smooth till\\nthe venturesome paper boats get into the swift eddies, or run\\naground upon the rocks and sandbars.\\n\\nThe greatest secrecy was to be preserved, and no one but Mrs.\\nSpenser was to know what a momentous enterprise was afoot. The girls\\nsat absorbed in their brilliant plans till it was nearly dark, then\\ngroped their way home hand in hand, leaving another secret for the\\nlaurels to keep and dream over through their long sleep, for blossom\\ntime was past, and the rosy faces turning pale in the July sun.\\n\\nNeither of the girls forgot the talk they had that night in Emily’s\\nroom, for she led her captive straight to her mother, and told her\\nall their plans and aspirations without a moment’s delay.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser much regretted her daughter’s well-meant enthusiasm,\\nbut fearing harm might be done, very wisely tried to calm the\\ninnocent excitement of both by the quiet matter-of-fact way in which\\nshe listened to the explanation Emily gave her, read the verses\\ntimidly offered by Becky, and then said, kindly but firmly:--\\n\\n“This is not poetry, my dear girls, though the lines run smoothly\\nenough, and the sentiment is sweet. It would bring neither fame nor\\nmoney, and Rebecca puts more real truth, beauty, and poetry into her\\ndutiful daily life than in any lines she has written.”\\n\\n“We had such a lovely plan for Becky to come to town with me, and\\nsee the world, and write, and be famous. How can you spoil it all?”\\n\\n“My foolish little daughter, I must prevent you from spoiling this\\ngood girl’s life by your rash projects. Becky will see that I am\\nwise, though you do not, and SHE will understand this verse from my\\nfavorite poet, and lay it to heart:--\\n\\n  “So near is grandeur to our Dust,\\n   So nigh is God to man,\\n   When Duty whispers low, ‘Thou must!’\\n    The youth replies, ‘I can!’”\\n\\n“I do! I will! please go on,” and Becky’s troubled eyes grew clear\\nand steadfast as she took the words home to herself, resolving to\\nlive up to them.\\n\\n“Oh, mother!” cried Emily, thinking her very cruel to nip their\\nbudding hopes in this way.\\n\\n“I know you won’t believe it now, nor be able to see all that I mean\\nperhaps, but time will teach you both to own that I am right, and to\\nvalue the substance more than the shadow,” continued Mrs. Spenser.\\n“Many girls write verses and think they are poets; but it is only a\\npassing mood, and fortunately for the world, and for them also, it\\nsoon dies out in some more genuine work or passion. Very few have\\nthe real gift, and those to whom it IS given wait and work and\\nslowly reach the height of their powers. Many delude themselves, and\\ntry to persuade the world that they can sing; but it is waste of\\ntime, and ends in disappointment, as the mass of sentimental rubbish\\nwe all see plainly proves. Write your little verses, my dear, when\\nthe spirit moves,--it is a harmless pleasure, a real comfort, and a\\ngood lesson for you; but do not neglect higher duties or deceive\\nyourself with false hopes and vain dreams. ‘First live, then write,’\\nis a good motto for ambitious young people. A still better for us\\nall is, ‘Do the duty that lies nearest;’ and the faithful\\nperformance of that, no matter how humble it is, will be the best\\nhelp for whatever talent may lie hidden in us, ready to bloom when\\nthe time comes. Remember this, and do not let my enthusiastic girl’s\\nwell-meant but unwise prophecies and plans unsettle you, and unfit\\nyou for the noble work you are doing.”\\n\\n“Thank you, ma’am! I WILL remember; I know you are right, and I\\nwon’t be upset by foolish notions. I never imagined before that I\\nCOULD be a poet; but it sounded so sort of splendid, I thought maybe\\nit MIGHT happen to me, by-and-by, as it does to other folks. I\\nwon’t lot on it, but settle right down and do my work cheerful.”\\n\\nAs she listened, Becky’s face had grown pale and serious, even a\\nlittle sad; but as she answered, her eyes shone, her lips were firm,\\nand her plain face almost beautiful with the courage and confidence\\nthat sprung up within her. She saw the wisdom of her friend’s\\nadvice, felt the kindness of showing her the mistake frankly, and\\nwas grateful for it,--conscious in her own strong, loving heart that\\nit was better to live and work for others than to dream and strive\\nfor herself alone.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser was both surprised and touched by the girl’s look,\\nwords, and manner, and her respect much increased by the courage and\\ngood temper with which she saw her lovely castle in the air vanish\\nlike smoke, leaving the hard reality looking harder than ever, after\\nthis little flight into the fairy regions of romance.\\n\\nShe talked long with the girls, and gave them the counsel all eager\\nyoung people need, yet are very slow to accept till experience\\nteaches them its worth. As the friend of many successful literary\\npeople, Mrs. Spenser was constantly receiving the confidences of\\nunfledged scribblers, each of whom was sure that he or she had\\nsomething valuable to add to the world’s literature. Her advice was\\nalways the same, “Work and wait;” and only now and then was a young\\npoet or author found enough in earnest to do both, and thereby prove\\nto themselves and others that either they DID possess power, or did\\nnot, and so settle the question forever. “First live, then write,”\\n proved a quietus for many, and “Do the duty that lies nearest”\\n satisfied the more sincere that they could be happy without fame.\\nSo, thanks to this wise and kindly woman, a large number of worthy\\nyouths and maidens ceased dreaming and fell to work, and the world\\nwas spared reams of feeble verse and third-rate romances.\\n\\nAfter that night Becky spent fewer spare hours in her nest, and more\\nin reading with Emily, who lent her books and helped her to\\nunderstand them,--both much assisted by Mrs. Spenser, who marked\\npassages, suggested authors, and explained whatever puzzled them.\\nVery happy bits of time were these, and very precious to both, as\\nEmily learned to see and appreciate the humbler, harder side of\\nlife, and Becky got delightful glimpses into the beautiful world of\\nart, poetry, and truth, which gave her better food for heart and\\nbrain than sentimental musings or blind efforts to satisfy the\\nhunger of her nature with verse-writing.\\n\\nTheir favorite places were in the big barn, on the front porch, or\\nby the spring. This last was Emily’s schoolroom, and she both taught\\nand learned many useful lessons there.\\n\\nOne day as Becky came to rest a few minutes and shell peas, Emily\\nput down her book to help; and as the pods flew, she said, nodding\\ntoward the delicate ferns that grew thickly all about the trough,\\nthe rock, and the grassy bank,--\\n\\n“We have these in our greenhouse, but I never saw them growing wild\\nbefore, and I don’t find them anywhere up here. How did you get such\\nbeauties, and make them do so well?”\\n\\n“Oh, they grow in nooks on the mountain hidden under the taller\\nferns, and in sly corners. But they don’t grow like these, and die\\nsoon unless transplanted and taken good care of. They always make me\\nthink of you,--so graceful and delicate, and just fit to live with\\ntea-roses in a hot-house, and go to balls in beautiful ladies’\\nbokays,” answered Becky, smiling at her new friend, always so\\ndainty, and still so delicate in spite of the summer’s rustication.\\n\\n“Thank you! I suppose I shall never be very strong or able to do\\nmuch; so I AM rather like a fern, and do live in a conservatory all\\nwinter, as I can’t go out a great deal. An idle thing, Becky!” and\\nEmily sighed, for she was born frail, and even her tenderly guarded\\nlife could not give her the vigor of other girls. But the sigh\\nchanged to a smile as she added,--\\n\\n“If I am like the fern, you are like your own laurel,--strong, rosy,\\nand able to grow anywhere. I want to carry a few roots home, and see\\nif they won’t grow in my garden. Then you will have me, and I you. I\\nonly hope YOUR plant will do as well as mine does here.”\\n\\n“It won’t! ever so many folks have taken roots away, but they never\\nthrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong. So I\\ntell ‘em to leave the dear bushes alone, and come up here and enjoy\\n‘em in their own place. You might keep a plant of it in your\\nhot-house, and it would blow I dare say; but it would never be half\\nso lovely as my acres of them, and I guess it would only make you\\nsad, seeing it so far from home, and pale and pining,” answered\\nBecky, with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountain-laurel\\nbraved the wintry snow, and came out fresh and early in the spring.\\n\\n“Then I’ll let it alone till I come next summer. But don’t you take\\nany of the fern into the house in the cold weather? I should think\\nit would grow in your sunny windows,” said Emily, pleased by the\\nfancy that it resembled herself.\\n\\n“I tried it, but it needs a damp place, and our cold nights kill it.\\nNo, it won’t grow in our old house; but I cover it with leaves, and\\nthe little green sprouts come up as hearty as can be out here. The\\nshade, the spring, the shelter of the rock, keep it alive, you see,\\nso it’s no use trying to move it.”\\n\\nBoth sat silent for a few minutes, as their hands moved briskly and\\nthey thought of their different lots. An inquisitive ray of sunshine\\npeeped in at them, touching Becky’s hair till it shone like red\\ngold. The same ray dazzled Emily’s eyes; she put up her hand to pull\\nher hat-brim lower, and touched the little curls on her forehead.\\nThis recalled her pet grievance, and made her say impatiently, as\\nshe pushed the thick short locks under her net,--\\n\\n“My hair is SUCH a plague! I don’t know what I am to do when I go\\ninto society by-and-by. This crop is so unbecoming, and I can’t\\nmatch my hair anywhere, it is such a peculiar shade of golden-auburn.”\\n\\n“It’s a pretty color, and I think the curls much nicer than a\\nboughten switch,” said Becky, quite unconscious that her own\\nluxuriant locks were of the true Titian red, and would be much\\nadmired by artistic eyes.\\n\\n“I don’t! I shall send to Paris to match it, and then wear a braid\\nround my head as you do sometimes. I suppose it will cost a fortune,\\nbut I WON’T have a strong-minded crop. A friend of mine got a lovely\\ngolden switch for fifty dollars.”\\n\\n“My patience! do folks pay like that for false hair?” asked Becky,\\namazed.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed. White hair costs a hundred, I believe, if it is long.\\nWhy, you could get ever so much for yours if you ever wanted to sell\\nit. I’ll take part of it, for in a little while mine will be as\\ndark, and I’d like to wear your hair, Becky.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mother would let me. She is very proud of our red\\nheads. If I ever do cut it, you shall have some. I may be hard up\\nand glad to sell it perhaps. My sakes! I smell the cake burning!”\\n and off flew Becky to forget the chat in her work.\\n\\nEmily did not forget it, and hoped Becky would be tempted, for she\\nreally coveted one of the fine braids, but felt shy about asking the\\npoor girl for even a part of her one beauty.\\n\\nSo July and August passed pleasantly and profitably to both girls,\\nand in September they were to part. No more was said about poetry;\\nand Emily soon became so interested in the busy, practical life\\nabout her that her own high-flown dreams were quite forgotten, and\\nshe learned to enjoy the sweet prose of daily labor.\\n\\nOne breezy afternoon as she and her mother sat resting from a stroll\\non the way-side bank among the golden-rod and asters, they saw Becky\\ncoming up the long hill with a basket on her arm. She walked slowly,\\nas if lost in thought, yet never missed pushing aside with a decided\\ngesture of her foot every stone that lay in her way. There were many\\nin that rocky path, but Becky left it smoother as she climbed, and\\npaused now and then to send some especially sharp or large one\\nspinning into the grassy ditch beside the road.\\n\\n“Isn’t she a curious girl, Mamma? so tired after her long walk to\\ntown, yet so anxious not to leave a stone in the way,” said Emily,\\nas they watched her slow approach.\\n\\n“A very interesting one to me, dear, because under that humble\\nexterior lies a fine, strong character. It is like Becky to clear\\nher way, even up a dusty hill where the first rain will wash out\\nmany more stones. Let us ask her why she does it. I’ve observed the\\nhabit before, and always meant to ask,” replied Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Here we are! Come and rest a minute, Becky, and tell us if you mend\\nroads as well as ever so many other things;” called Emily, beckoning\\nwith a smile, as the girl looked up and saw them.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a trick of mine; I caught it of Father when I was a little\\nthing, and do it without knowing it half the time,” said Becky,\\nsinking down upon a mossy rock, as if rest were welcome.\\n\\n“Why did he do it?” asked Emily, who knew that her friend loved to\\ntalk of her father.\\n\\n“Well, it’s a family failing I guess, for his father did the same,\\nonly HE began with his farm and let the roads alone. The land used\\nto be pretty much all rocks up here, you know, and farmers had to\\nclear the ground if they wanted crops. It was a hard fight, and took\\na sight of time and patience to grub out roots and blast rocks and\\npick up stones that seemed to grow faster than anything else. But\\nthey kept on, and now see!”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Becky pointed proudly to the wide, smooth fields lying\\nbefore them, newly shorn of grass or grain, waving with corn, or\\nrich in garden crops ripening for winter stores. Here and there were\\nrocky strips unreclaimed, as if to show what had been done; and\\nmassive stone walls surrounded pasture, field, and garden.\\n\\n“A good lesson in patience and perseverance, my dear, and does great\\nhonor to the men who made the wilderness blossom like the rose,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Then you can’t wonder that they loved it and we want to keep it. I\\nguess it would break Mother’s heart to sell this place, and we are\\nall working as hard as ever we can to pay off the mortgage. Then\\nwe’ll be just the happiest family in New Hampshire,” said Becky,\\nfondly surveying the old farm-house, the rocky hill, and the\\nprecious fields won from the forest.\\n\\n“You never need fear to lose it; we will see to that if you will let\\nus,” began Mrs. Spenser, who was both a rich and a generous woman.\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! but we won’t need help I guess; and if we should,\\nMrs. Taylor made us promise to come to her,” cried Becky. “She found\\nus just in our hardest time, and wanted to fix things then; but we\\nare proud in our way, and Mother said she’d rather work it off if\\nshe could. Then what did that dear lady do but talk to the folks\\nround here, and show ‘em how a branch railroad down to Peeksville\\nwould increase the value of the land, and how good this valley would\\nbe for strawberries and asparagus and garden truck if we could only\\nget it to market. Some of the rich men took up the plan, and we hope\\nit will be done this fall. It will be the making of us, for our land\\nis first-rate for small crops, and the children can help at that,\\nand with a deepot close by it would be such easy work. That’s what I\\ncall helping folks to help themselves. Won’t it be grand?”\\n\\nBecky looked so enthusiastic that Emily could not remain\\nuninterested, though market-gardening did not sound very romantic.\\n\\n“I hope it will come, and next year we shall see you all hard at it.\\nWhat a good woman Mrs. Taylor is!”\\n\\n“Ain’t she? and the sad part of it is, she can’t do and enjoy all\\nshe wants to, because her health is so poor. She was a country girl,\\nyou know, and went to work in the city as waiter in a boarding-house.\\nA rich man fell in love with her and married her, and she took care\\nof him for years, and he left her all his money. She was quite broken\\ndown, but she wanted to make his name loved and honored after his\\ndeath, as he hadn’t done any good while he lived; so she gives away\\nheaps, and is never tired of helping poor folks and doing all sorts\\nof grand things to make the world better. I call that splendid!”\\n\\n“So do I, yet it is only what you are doing in a small way, Becky,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser, as the girl paused out of breath. “Mrs. Taylor\\nclears the stones out of people’s paths, making their road easier to\\nclimb than hers has been, and leaving behind her fruitful fields for\\nothers to reap. This is a better work than making verses, for it is\\nthe real poetry of life, and brings to those who give themselves to\\nit, no matter in what humble ways, something sweeter than fame and\\nmore enduring than fortune.”\\n\\n“So it does! I see that now, and know why we love Father as we do,\\nand want to keep what he worked so hard to give us. He used to say\\nevery stone cleared away was just so much help to the boys; and he\\nused to tell me his plans as I trotted after him round the farm,\\nhelping all I could, being the oldest, and like him, he said.”\\n\\nBecky paused with full eyes, for not even to these good friends\\ncould she ever tell the shifts and struggles in which she had\\nbravely borne her part during the long hard years that had wrested\\nthe little homestead from the stony-hearted hills.\\n\\nThe musical chime of a distant clock reminded her that supper time\\nwas near, and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant\\nrest by the way-side. As she pulled out her handkerchief, a little\\nroll of pale blue ribbon fell from her pocket, and Emily caught it\\nup, exclaiming mischievously, “Are you going to make yourself fine\\nnext Sunday, when Moses Pennel calls, Becky?”\\n\\nThe girl laughed and blushed as she said, carefully folding up the\\nribbon,--\\n\\n“I’m going to do something with it that I like a sight better than\\nthat. Poor Moses won’t come any more, I guess. I’m not going to\\nleave Mother till the girls can take my place, and only then to\\nteach, if I can get a good school somewhere near.”\\n\\n“We shall see!” and Emily nodded wisely.\\n\\n“We shall!” and Becky nodded decidedly, as she trudged on up the\\nsteep hill beside Mrs. Spenser, while Emily walked slowly behind,\\npoking every stone she saw into the grass, unmindful of the\\ndetriment to her delicate shoes, being absorbed in a new and\\ncharming idea of trying to follow Mrs. Taylor’s example in a small\\nway.\\n\\nA week later the last night came, and just as they were parting for\\nbed, in rushed one of the boys with the exciting news that the\\nrailroad surveyors were in town, the folks talking about the grand\\nenterprise, and the fortune of the place made forever.\\n\\nGreat was the rejoicing in the old farm-house; the boys cheered, the\\nlittle girls danced, the two mothers dropped a happy tear as they\\nshook each other’s hands, and Emily embraced Becky, tenderly\\nexclaiming,--“There, you dear thing, is a great stone shoved out of\\nYOUR way, and a clear road to fortune at last; for I shall tell all\\nmy friends to buy your butter and eggs, and fruit and pigs, and\\neverything you send to market on that blessed railroad.”\\n\\n“A keg of our best winter butter is going by stage express to-morrow\\nanyway; and when our apples come, we shan’t need a railroad to get\\n‘em to you, my darling dear,” answered Becky, holding the delicate\\ngirl in her arms with a look and gesture half sisterly, half\\nmotherly, wholly fond and grateful.\\n\\nWhen Emily got to her room, she found that butter and apples were\\nnot all the humble souvenirs offered in return for many comfortable\\ngifts to the whole family.\\n\\nOn the table, in a pretty birch-bark cover, lay several of Becky’s\\nbest poems neatly copied, as Emily had expressed a wish to keep\\nthem; and round the rustic volume, like a ring of red gold, lay a\\ngreat braid of Becky’s hair, tied with the pale blue ribbon she had\\nwalked four miles to buy, that her present might look its best.\\n\\nOf course there were more embraces and kisses, and thanks and loving\\nwords, before Emily at last lulled herself to sleep planning a\\nChristmas box, which should supply every wish and want of the entire\\nfamily if she could find them out.\\n\\nNext morning they parted; but these were not mere summer friends,\\nand they did not lose sight of one another, though their ways lay\\nfar apart. Emily had found a new luxury to bring more pleasure into\\nlife, a new medicine to strengthen soul and body; and in helping\\nothers, she helped herself wonderfully.\\n\\nBecky went steadily on her dutiful way, till the homestead was free,\\nthe lads able to work the farm alone, the girls old enough to fill\\nher place, and the good mother willing to rest at last among her\\nchildren. Then Becky gave herself to teaching,--a noble task, for\\nwhich she was well fitted, and in which she found both profit and\\npleasure, as she led her flock along the paths from which she\\nremoved the stumbling-blocks for their feet, as well as for her\\nown. She put her poetry into her life, and made of it “a grand sweet\\nsong” in which beauty and duty rhymed so well that the country girl\\nbecame a more useful, beloved, and honored woman than if she had\\ntried to sing for fame which never satisfies.\\n\\nSo each symbolical plant stood in its own place, and lived its\\nappointed life. The delicate fern grew in the conservatory among\\ntea-roses and camelias, adding grace to every bouquet of which it\\nformed a part, whether it faded in a ball-room, or was carefully\\ncherished by some poor invalid’s bed-side,--a frail thing, yet with\\ntenacious roots and strong stem, nourished by memories of the rocky\\nnook where it had learned its lesson so well. The mountain-laurel\\nclung to the bleak hillside, careless of wintry wind and snow, as\\nits sturdy branches spread year by year, with its evergreen leaves\\nfor Christmas cheer, its rosy flowers for spring-time, its fresh\\nbeauty free to all as it clothed the wild valley with a charm that\\nmade a little poem of the lovely spot where the pines whispered,\\nwoodbirds sang, and the hidden brook told the sweet message it\\nbrought from the mountain-top where it was born.\\n\\n\\nThe End.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s A Garland for Girls, by Louisa May Alcott\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A GARLAND FOR GIRLS ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 5830-0.txt or 5830-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/3/5830/\\n\\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo and the Online Distributed\\nProofreading Team\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

       "[['THE PRINCE',\n",
       "  'Nicolo Machiavelli',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTranslated by W. K. Marriott\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members of the old Florentine nobility.\\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Il Magnifico. The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\\'s literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOUTH — Aet. 1-25—1469-94\\n\\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo. Savonarola\\'s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in \"The Prince,\" where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo\\'s grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\"\\nMachiavelli, in his \"History of Florence,\" gives us a picture of the young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \"They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.\" In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: \"I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your share.\" Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOFFICE — Aet. 25-43—1494-1512\\n\\nThe second period of Machiavelli\\'s life was spent in the service of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of Machiavelli\\'s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters which illustrate \"The Prince.\"\\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forli\" of \"The Prince,\" from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft summarized in \"The Prince,\" and was consequently driven out. He, also, it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the faith of princes.\\nMachiavelli\\'s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\" Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare Borgia\\'s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the \"hero\" of \"The Prince.\" Yet in \"The Prince\" the duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.\\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.\\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.\\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany, with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\\'s character has already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his wishes.\\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\\'s official career were filled with events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITERATURE AND DEATH — Aet. 43-58—1512-27\\n\\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\" After describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men. And because Dante says:\\n     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,\\n     Unfruitful else,\\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have composed a small work on \\'Principalities,\\' where I pour myself out as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince, especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\"\\nThe \"little book\" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\\' Medici. Although Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\\'s lifetime, \"The Prince\" was never published by him, and its text is still disputable.\\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\"\\nBefore Machiavelli had got \"The Prince\" off his hands he commenced his \"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\" which should be read concurrently with \"The Prince.\" These and several minor works occupied him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on one pretext or another it was not promulgated.\\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he was much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\" It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance of Cardinal de\\' Medici to write the \"History of Florence,\" a task which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer observes that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play with.\"\\nWhen the \"History of Florence\" was finished, Machiavelli took it to Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\\' Medici, who had in the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Prince\" for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florence\" to the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.\\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten of Liberty and Peace.\" Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\\n\\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name, it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholy necromancer,\" which so long haunted men\\'s vision, has begun to fade.\\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII, overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to write the \"History of Florence,\" rather than employ him in the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"The Prince,\" its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\\'s contemporaries; yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and conduct.\\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"The Prince\" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon. Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be—and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses; prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to a higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to fight.\\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\\'s that government should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society; to this \"high argument\" \"The Prince\" contributes but little. Machiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests \"The Prince\" with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.\\nIn translating \"The Prince\" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. \"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\" In \"The Prince,\" it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare\\'s time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example: the word \"intrattenere,\" employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \"entertain,\" and every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power.\" But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians,\" etc., using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\\'s meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\\nPrincipal works.

In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.\\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in \\'84, nor those of Pope Julius in \\'10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III — CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.\\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.\\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico\\'s own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\\n     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\\n     Sforza, who married Beatrice d\\'Este. He ruled over Milan\\n     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.\\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.\\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority. Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\\n     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\\n     \"intrattenere.\"\\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.\\n     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"\\n     born 1462, died 1515.\\n\\n     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.\\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.\\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.\\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage.\\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\\n     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\\n     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\\n     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\\n     crown.\\n\\n     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\\'Amboise,\\n     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV — WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\\n\\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.\\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.\\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.\\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V — CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\\n\\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.\\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines.\\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE\\'S OWN ARMS AND ABILITY\\n\\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties. Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.\\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by force.\\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\\n     (*) Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\\n\\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.\\n     (*) \"Le radici e corrispondenze,\" their roots (i.e.\\n     foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other\\n     states—a common meaning of \"correspondence\" and\\n     \"correspondency\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.\\n     (*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married\\n     Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo\\n     Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his\\n     own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited\\n     agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-\\n     1507) during the transactions which led up to the\\n     assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and\\n     along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left\\n     an account, written ten years before \"The Prince,\" of the\\n     proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto\\n     dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,\"\\n     etc., a translation of which is appended to the present\\n     work.\\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.\\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\\n     (*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d\\'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.\\n     (*) Ramiro d\\'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.\\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+) was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\\n     (*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\\n\\n     (+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San\\n     Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.\\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\\n     (*) San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio\\n     Sforza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII — CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\\n\\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other modern—and without entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\\n     (*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.\\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one\\'s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\\n     (*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the\\n     modern equivalent of Machiavelli\\'s thought when he speaks of\\n     \"crudelta\" than the more obvious \"cruelties.\"\\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX — CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\\n\\nBut coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.\\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him.\\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them. But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\\nNabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on the people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged—such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.\\n     (*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under\\n     Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\\n\\n     (+) Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in\\n     Machiavelli\\'s \"Florentine History,\" Book III.\\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED\\n\\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country. And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his people.\\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year\\'s eating, drinking, and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and defend them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI — CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\\n\\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live. These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly—yet now a king of France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\\n     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.\\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander\\'s time. Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\\n     (*) Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\\' Medici.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII — HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\\n\\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them.\\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.\\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.\\n     (*) \"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\" This is one of the\\n     bons mots of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with\\n     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only\\n     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the\\n     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. \"The\\n     History of Henry VII,\" by Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had\\n     conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind\\n     of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of\\n     Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope\\n     Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into\\n     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,\\n     rather than with swords to fight.\"\\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.\\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed and quite free.\\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains. After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.\\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,(*) allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of Pitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\\n     (*) Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\\n\\n     (+) Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of\\n     Naples.\\n\\n     (%) Giovanni Acuto.

You must understand that the empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.\\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.\\n     (*) Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio\\n     in Romagna. He was the leader of the famous \"Company of St\\n     George,\" composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in\\n     1409.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII — CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE\\'S OWN\\n\\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,(*) for his assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.\\n     (*) Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of\\n     Naples), surnamed \"The Catholic,\" born 1452, died 1516.\\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles.\\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,(*) to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels.\\n     (*) Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.\\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.\\nCharles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one\\'s own forces. And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.\\n     (*) Charles VII of France, surnamed \"The Victorious,\" born\\n     1403, died 1461.\\n\\n     (+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.\\n     (*) \"Many speakers to the House the other night in the\\n     debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most\\n     lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the\\n     British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr Balfour\\n     replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under\\n     the weight of its military obligations, he said that this\\n     was \\'wholly unhistorical.\\' He might well have added that the\\n     Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen\\n     acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that\\n     it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer\\n     recognized.\"—Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.\\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength. And one\\'s own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And the way to make ready one\\'s own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV — THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\\n\\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.\\nPhilopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\\n     (*) Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks,\" born 252 B.C.,\\n     died 183 B.C.\\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV — CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED\\n\\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity. Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI — CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\\n\\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.\\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects\\' or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects\\' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.\\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII — CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\\n\\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\\n     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and\\n     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:\\n     \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\\n     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)\\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\\n     (*) . . . against my will, my fate\\n     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,\\n     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow\\'rs,\\n     And guard with these severities my shores.\\n\\n     Christopher Pitt.\\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.\\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.\\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII(*) — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\\n\\n     (*) \"The present chapter has given greater offence than any\\n     other portion of Machiavelli\\'s writings.\" Burd, \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 297.\\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\\n     (*) \"Contesting,\" i.e. \"striving for mastery.\" Mr Burd\\n     points out that this passage is imitated directly from\\n     Cicero\\'s \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,\\n     unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud\\n     proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad\\n     posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\"\\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind.\\n     (*) \"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad\\n     votum).\" The words \"ad votum\" are omitted in the Testina\\n     addition, 1550.\\n\\n     Alexander never did what he said,\\n     Cesare never said what he did.\\n\\n     Italian Proverb.\\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*) friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\\n     (*) \"Contrary to fidelity\" or \"faith,\" \"contro alla fede,\"\\n     and \"tutto fede,\" \"altogether faithful,\" in the next\\n     paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro\\n     alla fede\" and \"tutto fede,\" were omitted in the Testina\\n     edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal\\n     authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word\\n     \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as\\n     rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\" Observe that the\\n     word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the\\n     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of\\n     belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably\\n     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his\\n     Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as\\n     follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\\n     Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his\\n     political scheme: \\'That the show of religion was helpful to\\n     the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and\\n     pernicious.\\'\"\\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.\\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.\\nOne prince(*) of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.\\n     (*) Ferdinand of Aragon. \"When Machiavelli was writing \\'The\\n     Prince\\' it would have been clearly impossible to mention\\n     Ferdinand\\'s name here without giving offence.\" Burd\\'s \"Il\\n     Principe,\" p. 308.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX — THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\\n\\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.\\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.\\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.\\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\\n     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan\\n     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\\'s\\n     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from\\n     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had\\n     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the\\n     Boscoli conspiracy.\\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.\\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.\\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.\\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself—it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles—you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.\\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.\\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.\\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\\'s ruin.\\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.\\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.\\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX — ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\\n\\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.\\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.\\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\\n     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and\\n     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the\\n     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.\\n     A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the\\n     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote\\n     Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when. They\\n     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine\\n     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me\\n     at once.\" Cf. \"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini,\\n     translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI — HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\\n\\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him. Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.\\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.\\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.\\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state.\\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\\n     (*) \"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\" \"Arti\" were\\n     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: \"Arte . . . a whole\\n     company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\" The\\n     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr\\n     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\\n     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\\n     \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace\\'s\\n     \"Russia,\" ed. 1905: \"The sons . . . were always during the\\n     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger\\n     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind—\\n     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and\\n     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual\\n     members.\" The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity,\\n     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or\\n     \"arte.\" Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind\\n     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only\\n     another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental\\n     company.\" In both words the underlying idea is that of a\\n     body of men united by an oath. \"Tribu\" were possibly gentile\\n     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals\\n     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\"\\n     would be most appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII — CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\\n\\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.\\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII — HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\\n\\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, respect for you abates.\\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt.\\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything. This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\\n     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the\\n     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of\\n     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus\\n     became involved in Italian politics.\\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.\\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him.\\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV — WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\\n\\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.\\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years\\' possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV — WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\\n\\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\\n     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older\\n     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty\\n     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this\\n     miserable universe.\" Sorel\\'s \"Eastern Question.\"\\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.\\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.\\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.\\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.\\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI — AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\\n\\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\\n     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\\n     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\\n     title of Clement VII.\\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.\\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.\\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head. Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour.\\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince.\\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears. What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him? What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch:\\n     Virtu contro al Furore\\n     Prendera l\\'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\\n     Che l\\'antico valore\\n     Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\\n\\n     Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,\\n     And it i\\' th\\' combat soon shall put to flight:\\n     For the old Roman valour is not dead,\\n     Nor in th\\' Italians\\' brests extinguished.\\n\\n     Edward Dacre, 1640.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\\n\\nBY\\n\\nNICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.\\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.\\nThus it arose that, men\\'s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody\\'s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.\\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.\\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.\\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends. But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d\\'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke\\'s quarters, where they should be seized.\\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.\\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.\\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\\'s quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.\\nBut the duke\\'s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\\n\\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\\n\\n\\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\\n\\n\\n\\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\\n\\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.\\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.\\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son\\'s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.\\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\\'s men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\\'s troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.\\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people\\'s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor\\'s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.\\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.\\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.\\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\" Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"\\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio\\'s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines\\' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.\\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy\\'s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio\\'s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio\\'s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.\\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\\'s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\\'s army. But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:\\n\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\"\\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\" answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less to me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the same.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not taken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and being told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesar died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.\" Having been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.\" He used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?\" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\" Castruccio answered: \"A helmet.\" Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\" On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\" Seeing on of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I pray God that you will let him feed you also.\" Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house from the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\" Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\" He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?\" asked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?\"\\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince, by Nicolo Machiavelli\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1232-h.htm or 1232-h.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/3/1232/\\n\\nProduced by John Bickers, David Widger and Others\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

I.\\n\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\\n\\n\"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"What is his name?\"\\n\\n\"Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"Is he married or single?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\n\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,\\n\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\\n\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.\"\\n\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\\'s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times them ill.\"\\n\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\n\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\n\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?\"\\n\\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.\"\\n\\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr. Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\\n\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,\" said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls,\" said she, when the door was shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart were entertained.\\n\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\"\\n\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Bingley, \"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\n\\n\"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, \"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife\\'s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger——\"\\n\\n\"If he had had any compassion for me,\" cried her husband impatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown——\"\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.\\n\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\n\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.\"\\n\\n\"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.\"\\n\\n\"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one meets it every where. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of every body\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man\\'s sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.—Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.—Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\\'s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him courteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n\"You began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \"You were Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n\\n\"Yes;—but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question—Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem as if——but however, it may all come to nothing you know.\"\\n\\n\"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,\" said Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure, Ma\\'am?—is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.—\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\\n\"Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with him, if I were you.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, Ma\\'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.\"\\n\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.\"\\n\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, \"is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly.\"\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet\\'s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them, was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother\\'s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.\"\\n\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\n\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\n\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\n\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\\n\\n\"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\n\\n\"With great energy;—but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.\"\\n\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\n\\n\"It will be her turn soon to be teazed,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!—If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added, \"Very well; if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with—\\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\\'—and I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\\n\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!—There is nothing like dancing after all.—I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, Sir;—and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage can dance.\"\\n\\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully;\" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;—\"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n\"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?—Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.—You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.\" And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,\\n\\n\"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.—I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n\"He is indeed—but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\\n\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\n\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\n\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!—What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\"\\n\\n\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray when am I to wish you joy?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.\"\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\\' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\\n\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\"\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\n\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of any body\\'s children, it should not be of my own however.\"\\n\\n\"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\n\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.—When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his regimentals.\"\\n\\n\"Mama,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\\'s library.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\\n\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\n\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n\"My dear Friend,\\n\\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. Yours ever,\\n\\n\"Caroline Bingley.\"\\n\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.\"\\n\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\n\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\n\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?\"\\n\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\n\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s purpose will be answered.\"\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy,\\n\\n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.\\n\\n\"Yours, &c.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.\"\\n\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.—Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.\\n\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.—That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.—Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\\n\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.\"\\n\\n\"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.\"\\n\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\n\\n\"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\\n\"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said Bingley.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"—A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\n\\n\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.\\n\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into.\"\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.\\n\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left so small a collection of books.—What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many generations.\"\\n\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.\"\\n\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\n\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or rather taller.\"\\n\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\\n\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.\"\\n\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\\n\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.\"\\n\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\n\\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \"there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones\\'s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her daughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n\"Indeed I have, Sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\\n\"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.\"\\n\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\n\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.\"\\n\\nEvery body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\\n\"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.\"\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.\\n\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!—He has always something to say to every body.—That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman,\" said Bingley.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, yes;—but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see any body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle\\'s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.\"\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on fine eyes.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.\\n\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\\n\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!\"\\n\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you—but I always mend my own.\"\\n\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?—At present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.\"\\n\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her brother—\"because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables.—Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\"\\n\\n\"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\\n\"The indirect boast;—for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\n\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\n\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself.\"\\n\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.\"\\n\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\n\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.—\"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her—\\n\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.—And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.—Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.\\n\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"in running away without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,—\\n\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,\\n\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.—You are charmingly group\\'d, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye.\"\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\\'s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with Miss Bennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy\\'s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!—When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,\\n\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?—I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.\"\\n\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.\"\\n\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;—but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.—I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. \"What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning\"—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. \"You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;—if the first, I should be completely in your way;—and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard any thing so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him—laugh at him.—Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"But upon my honour I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no—I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth—\"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.—But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;—\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.\"\\n\\n\"No\"—said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for.—It is I believe too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful.—My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.\"\\n\\n\"That is a failing indeed!\"—cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.—I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\\n\"And your defect is a propensity to hate every body.\"\\n\\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is wilfully to misunderstand them.\"\\n\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\"—cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.—\"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.\"\\n\\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.—Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.—Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.—But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\"\\n\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\"\\n\\n\"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger.\" Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.—\"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure. Why Jane—you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.—But—good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment.\"\\n\\n\"It is not Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained. \"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.\"\\n\\nHunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\n15th October.\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\nThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—\"There, Mrs. Bennet.\"—My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\\'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\n\\nWilliam Collins.\"\\n\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\\n\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.\"\\n\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.—Can he be a sensible man, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\\n\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"his letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\\n\\n\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.\"\\n\\n\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,—and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted——\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\'s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets up stairs.\\n\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\\n\\n\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?\"\\n\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.\"\\n\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.—These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.\"\\n\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.—Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.—Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,\\n\\n\"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,\\n\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess;—for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father\\'s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.—Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour\\'s tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.—\"As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession;—her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it?—It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips\\'s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips\\' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.\\n\\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\\'s shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant\\'s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips\\'s manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\n\\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n\"I know little of the game, at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life——\" Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Wickham;—\"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself—for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.—Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,—\"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no right to give my opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.—Here you are in your own family.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\\n\\n\"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\\n\"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.\"\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\\n\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could that be?—How could his will be disregarded?—Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\\n\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\\n\"This is quite shocking!—He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\\n\"Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?—what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.\"\\n\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him—I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"I can hardly be just to him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!\"—She could have added, \"A young man too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"—but she contented herself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\n\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendance, and when immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of affection to myself.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!—I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!—If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,—for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\\n\"It is wonderful,\"—replied Wickham,—\"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;—and pride has often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\n\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,—to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.—\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,—very, very proud.—As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her father\\'s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\"\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,\\n\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?—Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\n\\n\"Probably not;—but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,—allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.—The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.\\n\\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,—and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.—I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\"\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips\\'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;—she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.—The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\n\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, indeed;—and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?—Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\"\\n\\n\"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s favourite in such a manner,—one, whom his father had promised to provide for.—It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no.\"\\n\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.—If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\n\\n\"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing.—One does not know what to think.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon;—one knows exactly what to think.\"\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,—that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy\\'s looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.\\n\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough.—I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\n\\n\"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,—a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:—and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help for it however. Mr. Wickham\\'s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\\'s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.—It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\n\\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.—Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.\\n\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Heaven forbid!—That would be the greatest misfortune of all!—To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!—Do not wish me such an evil.\"\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\\' looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\\n\\n\"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.—I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.\\n\\n\"Very well.—That reply will do for the present.—Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.—But now we may be silent.\"\\n\\n\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.—We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\" said he. \"How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.—You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.\"\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,\\n\\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.\"\\n\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,\" replied Elizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.\\n\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, Sir.—You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,\\n\\n\"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.—We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\\n\"Books—Oh! no.—I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.—We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\\n\"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.\"\\n\\n\"The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?\" said he, with a look of doubt.\\n\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\\n\"Merely to the illustration of your character,\" said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.\\n\\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,\\n\\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!—Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. \"Excuse my interference.—It was kindly meant.\"\\n\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.—\"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.—Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley\\'s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.\"\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley\\'s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\n\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!—I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'night.\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.—Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"—It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley\\'s two sisters. Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.—It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower.—What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?—You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.\"\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\n\\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary\\'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.—Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\n\\n\"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.—Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.—I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do.—In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.—Many stared.—Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\\'s conversation to herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy\\'s farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\\n\\n\"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\"\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,\\n\\n\"Oh dear!—Yes—certainly.—I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection.—Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\" And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,\\n\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am, do not go.—I beg you will not go.—Mr. Collins must excuse me.—He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am going away myself.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.—I desire you will stay where you are.\"—And upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, \"Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:\\n\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s foot-stool, that she said, \\'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.—Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.\"\\n\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.—You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so.—Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\n\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins very gravely—\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,\\n\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.\"\\n\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these:—It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\n\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.\"\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;—she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.\\n\\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.\\n\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had finished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?—It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.\\n\\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was. \"Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\\n\"I have, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.—Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.\"\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;—and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!—What do you think has happened this morning?—Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\n\\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.—But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.—I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you.—I have done with you from this very day.—I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.—Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!—But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\\n\\n\"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation.—\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"—\\n\\n\"My dear Madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,\" he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter\\'s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt\\'s, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.—To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;—that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\\n\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\"\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?—Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\n\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you—\\n\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this winter.\"\\n\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should.\"\\n\\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.—He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.\" \"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\"\\n\\n\"What think you of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"—said Jane as she finished it. \"Is it not clear enough?—Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.—Will you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.—No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.\"\\n\\n\"That is right.—You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?\"\\n\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"How can you talk so?\"—said Jane faintly smiling,—\"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\n\\n\"I did not think you would;—and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.\"\\n\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;—its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband.—Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n\"My dear Madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,\\n\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my good sir?—You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.\"\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\n\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her\\'s, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\\n\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,—impossible!\"\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,\\n\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?—Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\n\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,—\"you must be surprised, very much surprised,—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\"\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"—and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!—And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?—Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease her.—Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.—It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.—She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued absence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth\\'s; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane\\'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.\"\\n\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\n\\n\"I should not mind any thing at all.\"\\n\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\"\\n\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail. How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\\'s own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!—Why should he have it more than anybody else?\"\\n\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\nEND OF VOL.

EGERTON,\\nMILITARY LIBRARY, WHITEHALL.\\n1813.\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\\'s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister\\'s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,\\n\\n\"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.\\n\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time therefore.—I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\\'s respectability, and Charlotte\\'s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body\\'s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.\"\\n\\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied Jane, \"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.\"\\n\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to design,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\n\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\\n\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.\"\\n\\n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother\\'s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\\'s best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day, \"your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\n\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.\"\\n\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\n\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour\\'s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\n\\n\"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with the sister? She will not be able to help calling.\"\\n\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\n\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy\\'s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman\\'s reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\\n\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is—you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\\n\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\"\\n\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it.—Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!—My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your Mother of inviting him.\"\\n\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; \"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied.\"\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she \"wished they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,\\n\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"That you certainly shall.\"\\n\\n\"And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?\"\\n\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.\\n\\n\"My father and Maria are to come to me in March,\" added Charlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them.\"\\n\\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\\'s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.\\n\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street.\"\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall soon see them here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.\\n\\n\"Your\\'s, &c.\"\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as, by Wickham\\'s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:—\"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\\'s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of every body—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\\'s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n\"But, my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\\n\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather\\'s death made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No—why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?\"\\n\\n\"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.\"\\n\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?\"\\n\\n\"Her not objecting, does not justify him. It only shews her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n\"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"but perhaps to the Lakes.\"\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \"My dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin\\'s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband\\'s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has several.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\\n\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!\"\\n\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!\"\\n\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.\"\\n\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She looks sickly and cross.—Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!\"\\n\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\n\\nScarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.—Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James\\'s.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.—Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.—Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.—Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her\\'s, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.—Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\\'s astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.—He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her\\'s, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother\\'s maiden name?—Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.—Lady Catherine then observed,\\n\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.—It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.—Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day.—Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\n\\n\"One of them does.\"\\n\\n\"Why did not you all learn?—You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your\\'s.—Do you draw?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\n\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\n\\n\"Not one.\"\\n\\n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\n\\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!—I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.\\n\\n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected.\"\\n\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe\\'s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you have given me a treasure.\\' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Ma\\'am, all.\"\\n\\n\"All!—What, all five out at once? Very odd!—And you only the second.—The younger ones out before the elder are married!—Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, Ma\\'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.—The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive!—I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her Ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.—Pray, what is your age?\"\\n\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth smiling, \"your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,—therefore you need not conceal your age.\"\\n\\n\"I am not one and twenty.\"\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins\\'s side, and as many bows on Sir William\\'s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship\\'s praise into his own hands.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nSir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses\\' reach. This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord —— and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,\\n\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment\\'s pause, added,\\n\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?\"\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,\\n\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\\n\\n\"We are speaking of music, Madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.\\n\\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s proficiency.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, Madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs. Jenkinson\\'s room. She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in that part of the house.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill breeding, and made no answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\\n\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not say that you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\n\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n\\n\"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you—but so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.\"\\n\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\"\\n\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\\'s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,\\n\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly so—I thank you.\"\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer—and, after a short pause, added,\\n\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\"\\n\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.\"\\n\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n\\n\"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.\"\\n\\n\"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\\'s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\n\\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.\"\\n\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\\n\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,\\n\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of this!\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. \"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.\"\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.—She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.—She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.—How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!—Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane\\'s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,\\n\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n\\n\"I have been making the tour of the Park,\" he replied, \"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\"\\n\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.\\n\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\n\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?\"\\n\\n\"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\\n\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\"\\n\\n\"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\"\\n\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl\\'s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,\\n\\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n\\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man—he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily—\"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n\\n\"Care of him!—Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\n\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?\"\\n\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.\"\\n\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam smiling. \"He only told me, what I have now told you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\\n\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.\" \"But,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.\"\\n\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is lessening the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.\\n\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather displeased by her staying at home.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,\\n\\n\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,\\n\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\\n\\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\\n\\n\"I might as well enquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.\\n\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, \"I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?\"\\n\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?\"\\n\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\n\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, \"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.\"\\n\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\\n\\n\"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.\\n\\n\"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n\\nThe tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\\n\\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\"—And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.—The envelope itself was likewise full.—Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—\\n\\n\"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.\\n\\n\"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,—and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.—Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.—But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.—If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your\\'s, I can only say that I am sorry.—The necessity must be obeyed—and farther apology would be absurd.—I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.—But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.—I had often seen him in love before.—At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental information, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.—Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.—If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.—If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.—That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,—but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.—I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;—I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.—My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.—But there were other causes of repugnance;—causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.—These causes must be stated, though briefly.—The situation of your mother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.—Pardon me.—It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.—I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.—He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.—The part which I acted, is now to be explained.—His sisters\\' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.—We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.—I described, and enforced them earnestly.—But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister\\'s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.—But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.—To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.—I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.—That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;—but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.—Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.—It is done, however, and it was done for the best.—On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education. My father was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister\\'s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\\'s chief object was unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n\"Fitzwilliam Darcy.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips\\'s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling. That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.—Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\n\\n\"How despicably have I acted!\" she cried.—\"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!—I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.—How humiliating is this discovery!—Yet, how just a humiliation!—Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.—Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.\"\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s explanation there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.—How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?—He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment;—and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had always been.—Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.—She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;—and as she considered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.—Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. She could think only of her letter.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been. \"What would she have said?—how would she have behaved?\" were questions with which she amused herself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.—\"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!—They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,\\n\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\" replied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.—I must be in town next Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"But my father cannot.—He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.—Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\n\\n\"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.—Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.—Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.—I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.\"\\n\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!—Your uncle!—He keeps a man-servant, does he?—I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?—Oh! Bromley, of course.—If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham\\'s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,\\n\\n\"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!—it was melancholy to leave her to such society!—But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\\n\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection;—the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, \"it seems but a day or two since we first came!—and yet how many things have happened!\"\\n\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\n\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!—How much I shall have to tell!\"\\n\\nElizabeth privately added, \"And how much I shall have to conceal.\"\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of —— in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, \"Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\n\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia; \"but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\" Then shewing her purchases: \"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.\"\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Are they indeed?\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat down to table. \"What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,\\n\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King. There\\'s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\\n\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\n\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her. Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n\"How nicely we are crammed in!\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can\\'t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\\'s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,—only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\n\\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.\\n\\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!\"\\n\\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me. I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her, of the regiment\\'s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s refusal must have given him.\\n\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,\" said she; \"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n\\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.\"\\n\\n\"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n\\n\"But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.\"\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.\\n\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth. \"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy\\'s, but you shall do as you chuse.\"\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\\'s genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\n\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little and then replied, \"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?\"\\n\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister\\'s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane\\'s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother soon afterwards, \"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n\\n\"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!\" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar\\'s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall break mine,\" said Lydia.\\n\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.\"\\n\\n\"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,\" added Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate two.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,\" said she, \"though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,\\n\\n\"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Already arisen!\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia\\'s folly.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character. Excuse me—for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia\\'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\n\\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia\\'s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia\\'s leaving home.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and Mr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, \"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And pray may I ask?\" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.\"\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,\\n\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\n\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,\\n\\n\"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father\\'s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;—and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?\" said her aunt. \"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.\"\\n\\nElizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.\\n\\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\\n\\n\\nMATLOCK\\n\\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE:\\n\\nA NOVEL.\\n\\nIN THREE VOLUMES.\\n\\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.\"\\n\\nVOL.

EGERTON,\\nMILITARY LIBRARY, WHITEHALL.\\n1813.\\n\\n\\nDOVE-DALE\\n\\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;—and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.—But no,\"—recollecting herself,—\"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret.\\n\\nShe longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, \"but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.—\"He is now gone into the army,\" she added, \"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.\\n\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, \"is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds\\'s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said—\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.\"\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\\n\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mr. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\n\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.\"\\n\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,\\n\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world.\"\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.—\"Can this be Mr. Darcy!\" thought she.\\n\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Yes, Ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\n\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt, as they walked, \"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.\\n\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she should enter the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added.—\"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.\"\\n\\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father\\'s life time.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s happiness were in his guardianship!—How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!—How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing\\'s Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion.\"\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband\\'s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.\\n\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you,—Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected. \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\\n\\n\"There is something a little stately in him to be sure,\" replied her aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\n\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?\"\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.\\n\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\"\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\\'s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\\'s civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply, he added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant\\'s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude.—Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go.—Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana\\'s reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;—a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\\n\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.\"\\n\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\\'s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried; \"I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,—no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,\\n\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \\'She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.\\' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but that was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!—Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!—But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?—Impossible. I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle\\'s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\\n\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough;—you cannot go yourself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?—A glass of wine;—shall I get you one?—You are very ill.\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you;\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length, she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My youngest sister has left all her friends—has eloped;—has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.\"\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added, in a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!—I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now.\"\\n\\n\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved—shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!—They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\\'s immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.\\n\\n\"When my eyes were opened to his real character.—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.—But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.—I know it cannot be long.\"\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy—again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.—Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant\\'s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;—but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.—Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.—Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;—was it so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.\"\\n\\n\"That is all settled;\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\n\\nBut wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\n\\n\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?\"\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\"\\n\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n\"I do, indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.\"\\n\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\\'s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other.\"\\n\\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\\'s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.\"\\n\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.\"\\n\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n\\n\"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n\\n\"And my mother—How is she? How are you all?\"\\n\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.\"\\n\\n\"But you—How are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you must have gone through!\"\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\\n\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he, \"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,—that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,\\n\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\n\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable—that one false step involves her in endless ruin—that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,—and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\n\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?\"\\n\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better;\" replied her sister. \"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\\n\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to his wife?\"\\n\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet,\\n\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to our good journey.\\n\\n\"Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n\"Lydia Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But at least it shews, that she was serious in the object of her journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\n\\n\"I never saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.—I hope there was.—But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.\"\\n\\n\"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\n\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.\"\\n\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\n\\nShe then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n\"He meant, I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\\'s family. Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street. That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect.\\n\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.\\n\\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ——shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning\\'s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:\\n\\n\"My dear Sir,\\n\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent\\'s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\\n\\n\"I am, dear Sir, &c. &c.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\" she cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!\" she cried. \"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\"\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\n\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\n\\n\"She is happy, then,\" said her father, drily; \"and her residence there will probably be of some duration.\"\\n\\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, \"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\\'s tea.\\n\\n\"This is a parade,\" cried he, \"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,—or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.\"\\n\\n\"I am not going to run away, Papa,\" said Kitty, fretfully; \"if I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\n\\n\"You go to Brighton!—I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\"\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\"\\n\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.\"\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;—their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,\\n\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking towards the little copse.\"\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,\\n\\n\"Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?\"\\n\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; \"but perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what it is about.\"\\n\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Monday,\\nAugust 2.\\n\\n\"My dear Brother,\\n\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both——\"\\n\\n\"Then it is, as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\n\\nElizabeth read on; \"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on. Your\\'s, &c.\\n\\n\"Edw. Gardiner.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible!\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \"Can it be possible that he will marry her?\"\\n\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;\" said her sister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back, and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.\"\\n\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n\"And may I ask?\" said Elizabeth, \"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\"\\n\\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\n\\n\"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know:—one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.\"\\n\\n\"Money! my uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, Sir?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said her father, \"Wickham\\'s a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\n\\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \"How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!\"\\n\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\n\\n\"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\" said Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\n\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\" said Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\"\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,\\n\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\n\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\n\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried: \"This is delightful indeed!—She will be married!—I shall see her again!—She will be married at sixteen!—My good, kind brother!—I knew how it would be—I knew he would manage every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia!—How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy. In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\\'s delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.\\n\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\n\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expences had been very little within that sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.\\n\\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\n\\n\"Haye-Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\\'s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\\'s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.\\n\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s. It is Mr. Wickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.—Your\\'s, &c.\\n\\n\"E. Gardiner.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\\'s removal from the ——shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——\\'s regiment.\"\\n\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nTheir sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\n\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.\"\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham,\" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\\n\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\n\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\\'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\\n\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\\n\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\\'s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\\n\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\n\\n\"Not that I shall though,\" she added to herself, as she finished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\n\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\n\\n\"My dear niece,\\n\\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\\'s flight, on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\n\\n\"M. Gardiner.\"\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt\\'s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he, as he joined her.\\n\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better.\"\\n\\n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\n\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n\\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n\\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.\"\\n\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,\\n\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! I don\\'t know. Not these two or three years perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\\'s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with one\\'s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n\\n\"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\"\\n\\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.\\n\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news.) \"Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher\\'s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\\n\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\n\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself.\"\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you will wait on him of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\'s errand again.\"\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\"\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near,\\n\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\n\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what\\'s his name. That tall, proud man.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\\n\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early enough for expectation.\"\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\n\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\n\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \\'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing. It was my brother Gardiner\\'s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.\\n\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\n\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\\'s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\\n\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\" said she, \"did he come at all?\"\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him.\"\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly. \"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now.\"\\n\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.\"\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother\\'s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for ever.\"\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\n\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?\"\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\n\\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\n\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.\"\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas\\'s last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? \\'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\"\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man.\"\\n\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\n\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\n\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come.—He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\n\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?\"\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\\n\\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give into it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,\\n\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s concurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s schemes.\\n\\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not every body as happy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.\\n\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious circumspection! of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say.\"\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,\\n\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.\\n\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in me.\"\\n\\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha\\'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.\"\\n\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for it?\"\\n\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\n\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!\"\\n\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.\"\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!\"\\n\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine. \"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.\\n\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,\\n\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\n\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\n\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in her face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—\\n\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\n\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth, coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\n\\n\"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions, which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n\\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.\"\\n\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\n\\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\n\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.\"\\n\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\n\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?\\n\\n\"Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\n\\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up.\"\\n\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s daughter; so far we are equal.\"\\n\\n\"True. You are a gentleman\\'s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\n\\n\"I am not.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require.\"\\n\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\\'s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man\\'s marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew\\'s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father\\'s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully answered. \"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.\"\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.\"\\n\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n\\n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n\\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.\"\\n\\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.\"\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\\n\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set that down, as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,\\n\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest.\"\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,\\n\\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?\"\\n\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. \"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.\"\\n\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\" \"This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.\"\\n\\n\"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\n\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\\n\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\" \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\" \"That is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be Missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!\"\\n\\n\"Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\\'s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your\\'s. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\n\\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.\"\\n\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\"\\n\\nElizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\n\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \\'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.\\' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.\"\\n\\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?\"\\n\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\n\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\n\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only child) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?\"\\n\\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.\"\\n\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.\"\\n\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.\"\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\\n\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.\\n\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.\\n\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he \"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.\\n\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n\\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.\"\\n\\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.\"\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.\"\\n\\n\"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried Jane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n\\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest sister, now be be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\n\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\n\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.\\n\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia\\'s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\n\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?\"\\n\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\n\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father\\'s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?\"\\n\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my indifference?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane\\'s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! \\'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\n\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could you begin?\" said she. \"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\n\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?\"\\n\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\n\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\"\\n\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\n\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\\n\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\n\\n\"And so was I.\"\\n\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do.\"\\n\\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your\\'s. My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\\n\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?\"\\n\\n\"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.\"\\n\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\"\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter, but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\n\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\n\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\n\\n\"Dear Sir,\\n\\n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\\n\\n\"Your\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Philips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy,\\n\\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n\\n\"Yours, &c.\"\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.\\n\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\\'s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n'],\n",

Where is the Opposition\\nthat has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism,\\nagainst the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against\\nits reactionary adversaries?\\n\\nTwo things result from this fact.\\n\\nI.  Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers\\nto be itself a Power.\\n\\nII.  It is high time that Communists should openly, in the\\nface of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their\\ntendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of\\nCommunism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\\n\\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have\\nassembled in London, and sketched the following Manifesto, to be\\npublished in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and\\nDanish languages.\\n\\n\\n\\nI.  BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS\\n\\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history\\nof class struggles.\\n\\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf,\\nguild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed,\\nstood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an\\nuninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time\\nended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at\\nlarge, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\\n\\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a\\ncomplicated arrangement of society into various orders, a\\nmanifold gradation of social rank.  In ancient Rome we have\\npatricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages,\\nfeudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices,\\nserfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate\\ngradations.\\n\\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins\\nof feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms.  It\\nhas but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,\\nnew forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  Our epoch, the\\nepoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive\\nfeature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a\\nwhole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps,\\ninto two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie\\nand Proletariat.\\n\\nFrom the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers\\nof the earliest towns.  From these burgesses the first elements\\nof the bourgeoisie were developed.\\n\\nThe discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up\\nfresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and\\nChinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with\\nthe colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in\\ncommodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to\\nindustry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the\\nrevolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nThe feudal system of industry, under which industrial production\\nwas monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the\\ngrowing wants of the new markets.  The manufacturing system took\\nits place.  The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the\\nmanufacturing middle class; division of labour between the\\ndifferent corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of\\nlabour in each single workshop.\\n\\nMeantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising.\\nEven manufacture no longer sufficed.  Thereupon, steam and\\nmachinery revolutionised industrial production.  The place of\\nmanufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of\\nthe industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the\\nleaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.\\n\\nModern industry has established the world-market, for which the\\ndiscovery of America paved the way.  This market has given an\\nimmense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication\\nby land.  This development has, in its time, reacted on the\\nextension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce,\\nnavigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the\\nbourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the\\nbackground  every class handed down from the Middle Ages.\\n\\nWe see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the\\nproduct of a long course of development, of a series of\\nrevolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.\\n\\nEach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied\\nby a corresponding political advance of that class.  An\\noppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an\\narmed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune;\\nhere independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany),\\nthere taxable \"third estate\" of the monarchy (as in France),\\nafterwards, in the  period of manufacture proper, serving either\\nthe semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise\\nagainst the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the great\\nmonarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the\\nestablishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market,\\nconquered for itself, in the modern representative State,\\nexclusive political sway.  The executive of the modern State is\\nbut a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary\\npart.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an\\nend to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  It has\\npitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to\\nhis \"natural superiors,\" and has left remaining no other nexus\\nbetween man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash\\npayment.\"  It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of\\nreligious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine\\nsentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.  It\\nhas resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of\\nthe numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that\\nsingle, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.  In one word, for\\nexploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked,\\nshameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation\\nhitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.  It has\\nconverted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the\\nman of science, into its paid wage labourers.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental\\nveil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money\\nrelation.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the\\nbrutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists\\nso much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful\\nindolence.  It has been the first to show what man\\'s activity can\\nbring about.  It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian\\npyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has\\nconducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses\\nof nations and crusades.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising\\nthe instruments of production, and thereby the relations of\\nproduction, and with them the whole relations of society.\\nConservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form,\\nwas, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all\\nearlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of\\nproduction, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions,\\neverlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois\\nepoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations,\\nwith their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and\\nopinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated\\nbefore they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all\\nthat is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face\\nwith sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his\\nrelations with his kind.\\n\\nThe need of a constantly expanding market for its products\\nchases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It\\nmust nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions\\neverywhere.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market\\ngiven a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in\\nevery country.  To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has\\ndrawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on\\nwhich it stood.  All old-established national industries have\\nbeen destroyed or are daily being destroyed.  They are dislodged\\nby new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death\\nquestion for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer\\nwork up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the\\nremotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only\\nat home, but in every quarter of the globe.  In place of the old\\nwants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new\\nwants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant\\nlands and climes.  In place of the old local and national\\nseclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every\\ndirection, universal inter-dependence of nations.  And as in\\nmaterial, so also in intellectual production.  The intellectual\\ncreations of individual nations become common property.  National\\none-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more\\nimpossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures,\\nthere arises a world literature.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of\\nproduction, by the immensely facilitated means of communication,\\ndraws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.\\nThe cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with\\nwhich it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the\\nbarbarians\\' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to\\ncapitulate.  It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to\\nadopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to\\nintroduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to\\nbecome bourgeois themselves.  In one word, it creates a world\\nafter its own image.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the\\ntowns.  It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the\\nurban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued\\na considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural\\nlife.  Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so\\nit has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on\\nthe civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois,\\nthe East on the West.\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the\\nscattered state of the population, of the means of production,\\nand of property.  It has agglomerated production, and has\\nconcentrated property in a few hands.  The necessary consequence\\nof this was political centralisation.  Independent, or but\\nloosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws,\\ngovernments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into\\none nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national\\nclass-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.  The\\nbourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has\\ncreated more massive and more colossal productive forces than\\nhave all preceding generations together.  Subjection of Nature\\'s\\nforces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry\\nand agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs,\\nclearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of\\nrivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground--what\\nearlier century had even a presentiment that such productive\\nforces slumbered in the lap of social labour?\\n\\nWe see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose\\nfoundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in\\nfeudal society.  At a certain stage in the development of these\\nmeans of production and of exchange, the conditions under which\\nfeudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of\\nagriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal\\nrelations of property became no longer compatible with the\\nalready developed productive forces; they became so many fetters.\\nThey had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.\\n\\nInto their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a\\nsocial and political constitution adapted to it, and by the\\neconomical and political sway of the bourgeois class.\\n\\nA similar movement is going on before our own eyes.  Modern\\nbourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange\\nand of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic\\nmeans of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is\\nno longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he\\nhas called up by his spells.  For many a decade past the history\\nof industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of\\nmodern productive forces against modern conditions of production,\\nagainst the property relations that are the conditions for the\\nexistence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.  It is enough to\\nmention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put\\non its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the\\nentire bourgeois society.  In these crises a great part not only\\nof the existing products, but also of the previously created\\nproductive forces, are periodically destroyed.  In these crises\\nthere breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would\\nhave seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.\\nSociety suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary\\nbarbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of\\ndevastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;\\nindustry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  Because\\nthere is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence,\\ntoo much industry, too much commerce.  The productive forces at\\nthe disposal of society no longer tend to further the development\\nof the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they\\nhave become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are\\nfettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring\\ndisorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the\\nexistence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois\\nsociety are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.\\nAnd how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  On the one\\nhand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the\\nother, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough\\nexploitation of the old ones.  That is to say, by paving the\\nway for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by\\ndiminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.\\n\\nThe weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the\\nground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\\n\\nBut not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring\\ndeath to itself; it has also called into existence the men who\\nare to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the\\nproletarians.\\n\\nIn proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed,\\nin the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working\\nclass, developed--a class of labourers, who live only so long\\nas they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour\\nincreases capital.  These labourers, who must sell themselves\\npiece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of\\ncommerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of\\ncompetition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\\n\\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of\\nlabour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual\\ncharacter, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  He\\nbecomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most\\nsimple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is\\nrequired of him.  Hence, the cost of production of a workman is\\nrestricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he\\nrequires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his\\nrace.  But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of\\nlabour, is equal to its cost of production.  In proportion\\ntherefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage\\ndecreases.  Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and\\ndivision of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden\\nof toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working\\nhours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by\\nincreased speed of the machinery, etc.\\n\\nModern industry has converted the little workshop of the\\npatriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial\\ncapitalist.  Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are\\norganised like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they\\nare placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers\\nand sergeants.  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class,\\nand of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by\\nthe machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the\\nindividual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  The more openly this\\ndespotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty,\\nthe more hateful and the more embittering it is.\\n\\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual\\nlabour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes\\ndeveloped, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of\\nwomen. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive\\nsocial validity for the working class. All are instruments of\\nlabour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age\\nand sex.\\n\\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer,\\nso far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is\\nset upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord,\\nthe shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\\n\\nThe lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople,\\nshopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and\\npeasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly\\nbecause their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale\\non which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the\\ncompetition with the large capitalists, partly because their\\nspecialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of\\nproduction.  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes\\nof the population.\\n\\nThe proletariat goes through various stages of development.\\nWith its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  At\\nfirst the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by\\nthe workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade,\\nin one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly\\nexploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the\\nbourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments\\nof production themselves; they destroy imported wares that\\ncompete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they\\nset factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished\\nstatus of the workman of the Middle Ages.\\n\\nAt this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass\\nscattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual\\ncompetition.  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,\\nthis is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of\\nthe union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its\\nown political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in\\nmotion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so.  At this\\nstage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies,\\nbut the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute\\nmonarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty\\nbourgeoisie.  Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated\\nin the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a\\nvictory for the bourgeoisie.\\n\\nBut with the development of industry the proletariat not only\\nincreases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses,\\nits strength grows, and it feels that strength more.  The various\\ninterests and conditions of life within the ranks of the\\nproletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as\\nmachinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly\\neverywhere reduces wages to the same low level.  The growing\\ncompetition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial\\ncrises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.  The\\nunceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing,\\nmakes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions\\nbetween individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and\\nmore the character of collisions between two classes.  Thereupon\\nthe workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against\\nthe bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of\\nwages; they found permanent associations in order to make\\nprovision beforehand for these occasional revolts.  Here and\\nthere the contest breaks out into riots.\\n\\nNow and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.\\nThe real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate\\nresult, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.  This\\nunion is helped on by the improved means of communication that\\nare created by modern industry and that place the workers of\\ndifferent localities in contact with one another.  It was just\\nthis contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local\\nstruggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle\\nbetween classes.  But every class struggle is a political\\nstruggle.  And that union, to attain which the burghers of the\\nMiddle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries,\\nthe modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few\\nyears.\\n\\nThis organisation of the proletarians into a class, and\\nconsequently into a political party, is continually being upset\\nagain by the competition between the workers themselves.  But it\\never rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.  It compels\\nlegislative recognition of particular interests of the workers,\\nby taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie\\nitself.  Thus the ten-hours\\' bill in England was carried.\\n\\nAltogether collisions between the classes of the old society\\nfurther, in many ways, the course of development of the\\nproletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant\\nbattle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those\\nportions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become\\nantagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the\\nbourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees\\nitself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its\\nhelp, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The\\nbourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its\\nown instruments of political and general education, in other\\nwords, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting\\nthe bourgeoisie.\\n\\nFurther, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling\\nclasses are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the\\nproletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of\\nexistence.  These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements\\nof enlightenment and progress.\\n\\nFinally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive\\nhour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling\\nclass, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a\\nviolent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling\\nclass cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the\\nclass that holds the future in its hands.  Just as, therefore, at\\nan earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the\\nbourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the\\nproletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois\\nideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of\\ncomprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.\\n\\nOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie\\ntoday, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.\\nThe other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of\\nModern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential\\nproduct.  The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the\\nshopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the\\nbourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions\\nof the middle class.  They are therefore not revolutionary, but\\nconservative.  Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try\\nto roll back the wheel of history.  If by chance they are\\nrevolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending\\ntransfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their\\npresent, but their future interests, they desert their own\\nstandpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\\n\\nThe \"dangerous class,\" the social scum, that passively rotting\\nmass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may,\\nhere and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian\\nrevolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more\\nfor the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.\\n\\nIn the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at\\nlarge are already virtually swamped.  The proletarian is without\\nproperty; his relation to his wife and children has no longer\\nanything in common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern\\nindustrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in\\nEngland as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him\\nof every trace of national character.  Law, morality, religion,\\nare to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in\\nambush just as many bourgeois interests.\\n\\nAll the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to\\nfortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at\\nlarge to their conditions of appropriation.  The proletarians\\ncannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except\\nby abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and\\nthereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  They\\nhave nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission\\nis to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of,\\nindividual property.\\n\\nAll previous historical movements were movements of minorities,\\nor in the interests of minorities.  The proletarian movement is\\nthe self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority,\\nin the interests of the immense majority.  The proletariat, the\\nlowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise\\nitself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official\\nsociety being sprung into the air.\\n\\nThough not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the\\nproletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.\\nThe proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all\\nsettle matters with its own bourgeoisie.\\n\\nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the\\nproletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging\\nwithin existing society, up to the point where that war breaks\\nout into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the\\nbourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\\n\\nHitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have\\nalready seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed\\nclasses.  But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions\\nmust be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its\\nslavish existence.  The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised\\nhimself to membership in the commune, just as the petty\\nbourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to\\ndevelop into a bourgeois.  The modern laborer, on the contrary,\\ninstead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and\\ndeeper below the conditions of existence of his own class.  He\\nbecomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than\\npopulation and wealth.  And here it becomes evident, that the\\nbourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in\\nsociety, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society\\nas an over-riding law.  It is unfit to rule because it is\\nincompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his\\nslavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a\\nstate, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.\\nSociety can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other\\nwords, its existence is no longer compatible with society.\\n\\nThe essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of\\nthe bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of\\ncapital; the condition for capital is wage-labour.  Wage-labour\\nrests exclusively on competition between the laborers.  The\\nadvance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie,\\nreplaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition,\\nby their revolutionary combination, due to association.  The\\ndevelopment of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its\\nfeet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and\\nappropriates products.  What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces,\\nabove all, is its own grave-diggers.  Its fall and the victory of\\nthe proletariat are equally inevitable.\\n\\n\\n\\nII.  PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS\\n\\nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a\\nwhole?\\n\\nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other\\nworking-class parties.\\n\\nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of the\\nproletariat as a whole.\\n\\nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own,\\nby which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.\\n\\nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties\\nby this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians\\nof the different countries, they point out and bring to the front\\nthe common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of\\nall nationality.  (2) In the various stages of development which the\\nstruggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass\\nthrough, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the\\nmovement as a whole.\\n\\nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically,\\nthe most advanced and resolute section of the working-class\\nparties of every country, that section which pushes forward\\nall others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over\\nthe great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly\\nunderstanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate\\ngeneral results of the proletarian movement.\\n\\nThe immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all\\nthe other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into\\na class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of\\npolitical power by the proletariat.\\n\\nThe theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way\\nbased on ideas or principles that have been invented, or\\ndiscovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  They\\nmerely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from\\nan existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on\\nunder our very eyes.  The abolition of existing property\\nrelations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.\\n\\nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject\\nto historical change consequent upon the change in historical\\nconditions.\\n\\nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in\\nfavour of bourgeois property.\\n\\nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of\\nproperty generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But\\nmodern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete\\nexpression of the system of producing and appropriating products,\\nthat is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the\\nmany by the few.\\n\\nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in\\nthe single sentence: Abolition of private property.\\n\\nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing\\nthe right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a\\nman\\'s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork\\nof all personal freedom, activity and independence.\\n\\nHard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  Do you mean the\\nproperty of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of\\nproperty that preceded the bourgeois form?  There is no need to\\nabolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent\\nalready destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\\n\\nOr do you mean modern bourgeois private property?\\n\\nBut does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not\\na bit.  It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which\\nexploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon\\ncondition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh\\nexploitation.  Property, in its present form, is based on the\\nantagonism of capital and wage-labour.  Let us examine both sides\\nof this antagonism.\\n\\nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a\\nsocial status in production.  Capital is a collective product,\\nand only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last\\nresort, only by the united action of all members of society,\\ncan it be set in motion.\\n\\nCapital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into\\nthe property of all members of society, personal property is not\\nthereby transformed into social property. It is only the social\\ncharacter of the property that is changed. It loses its\\nclass-character.\\n\\nLet us now take wage-labour.\\n\\nThe average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,\\nthat quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely\\nrequisite in bare existence as a labourer.  What, therefore, the\\nwage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely\\nsuffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  We by no\\nmeans intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the\\nproducts of labour, an appropriation that is made for the\\nmaintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no\\nsurplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  All that we\\nwant to do away with, is the miserable character of this\\nappropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase\\ncapital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of\\nthe ruling class requires it.\\n\\nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase\\naccumulated labour.  In Communist society, accumulated labour\\nis but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence\\nof the labourer.\\n\\nIn bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present;\\nin Communist society, the present dominates the past.  In\\nbourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality,\\nwhile the living person is dependent and has no individuality.\\n\\nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the\\nbourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly\\nso. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois\\nindependence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.\\n\\nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of\\nproduction, free trade, free selling and buying.\\n\\nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying\\ndisappears also.  This talk about free selling and buying, and\\nall the other \"brave words\" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in\\ngeneral, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted\\nselling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages,\\nbut have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of\\nbuying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,\\nand of the bourgeoisie itself.\\n\\nYou are horrified at our intending to do away with private\\nproperty.  But in your existing society, private property is\\nalready done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its\\nexistence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the\\nhands of those nine-tenths.  You reproach us, therefore, with\\nintending to do away with a form of property, the necessary\\ncondition for whose existence is the non-existence of any\\nproperty for the immense majority of society.\\n\\nIn one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your\\nproperty.  Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\\n\\nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into\\ncapital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being\\nmonopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can\\nno longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital,\\nfrom that moment, you say individuality vanishes.\\n\\nYou must, therefore, confess that by \"individual\" you mean no\\nother person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of\\nproperty.  This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and\\nmade impossible.\\n\\nCommunism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the\\nproducts of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the\\npower to subjugate the labour of others by means of such\\nappropriation.\\n\\nIt has been objected that upon the abolition of private property\\nall work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.\\n\\nAccording to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone\\nto the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who\\nwork, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not\\nwork. The whole of this objection is but another expression of\\nthe tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when\\nthere is no longer any capital.\\n\\nAll objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing\\nand appropriating material products, have, in the same way,\\nbeen urged against the Communistic modes of producing and\\nappropriating intellectual products.  Just as, to the bourgeois,\\nthe disappearance of class property is the disappearance of\\nproduction itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to\\nhim identical with the disappearance of all culture.\\n\\nThat culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous\\nmajority, a mere training to act as a machine.\\n\\nBut don\\'t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended\\nabolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois\\nnotions of freedom, culture, law, etc.  Your very ideas are but\\nthe outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and\\nbourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of\\nyour class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential\\ncharacter and direction are determined by the economical\\nconditions of existence of your class.\\n\\nThe selfish misconception that induces you to transform into\\neternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms\\nspringing from your present mode of production and form of\\nproperty--historical relations that rise and disappear in the\\nprogress of production--this misconception you share with every\\nruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the\\ncase of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal\\nproperty, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of\\nyour own bourgeois form of property.\\n\\nAbolition of the family!  Even the most radical flare up at this\\ninfamous proposal of the Communists.\\n\\nOn what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family,\\nbased?  On capital, on private gain.  In its completely developed\\nform this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.  But this\\nstate of things finds its complement in the practical absence of\\nthe family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\\n\\nThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its\\ncomplement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of\\ncapital.\\n\\nDo you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of\\nchildren by their parents?  To this crime we plead guilty.\\n\\nBut, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations,\\nwhen we replace home education by social.\\n\\nAnd your education!  Is not that also social, and determined by the\\nsocial conditions under which you educate, by the intervention,\\ndirect or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.?  The\\nCommunists have not invented the intervention of society in\\neducation; they do but seek to alter the character of that\\nintervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the\\nruling class.\\n\\nThe bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about\\nthe hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the\\nmore disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all\\nfamily ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their\\nchildren transformed into simple articles of commerce and\\ninstruments of labour.\\n\\nBut you Communists would introduce community of women, screams\\nthe whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\\n\\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.\\nHe hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited\\nin common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than\\nthat the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the\\nwomen.\\n\\nHe has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away\\nwith the status of women as mere instruments of production.\\n\\nFor the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the\\nvirtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women\\nwhich, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established\\nby the Communists.  The Communists have no need to introduce\\ncommunity of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\\n\\nOur bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters\\nof their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common\\nprostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other\\'s\\nwives.\\n\\nBourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common\\nand thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly\\nbe reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in\\nsubstitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised\\ncommunity of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the\\nabolition of the present system of production must bring with it\\nthe abolition of the community of women springing from that\\nsystem, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\\n\\nThe Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish\\ncountries and nationality.\\n\\nThe working men have no country.  We cannot take from them what\\nthey have not got.  Since the proletariat must first of all\\nacquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of\\nthe nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far,\\nitself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\\n\\nNational differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily\\nmore and more vanishing, owing to the development of the\\nbourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to\\nuniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of\\nlife corresponding thereto.\\n\\nThe supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still\\nfaster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at\\nleast, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of\\nthe proletariat.\\n\\nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another\\nis put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will\\nalso be put an end to.  In proportion as the antagonism between\\nclasses within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation\\nto another will come to an end.\\n\\nThe charges against Communism made from a religious, a\\nphilosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint,\\nare not deserving of serious examination.\\n\\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man\\'s ideas,\\nviews and conceptions, in one word, man\\'s consciousness, changes\\nwith every change in the conditions of his material existence, in\\nhis social relations and in his social life?\\n\\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that\\nintellectual production changes its character in proportion as\\nmaterial production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age\\nhave ever been the ideas of its ruling class.\\n\\nWhen people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do\\nbut express the fact, that within the old society, the elements\\nof a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the\\nold ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old\\nconditions of existence.\\n\\nWhen the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient\\nreligions were overcome by Christianity.  When Christian ideas\\nsuccumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal\\nsociety fought its death battle with the then revolutionary\\nbourgeoisie.  The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of\\nconscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition\\nwithin the domain of knowledge.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" it will be said, \"religious, moral, philosophical\\nand juridical ideas have been modified in the course of\\nhistorical development.  But religion, morality philosophy,\\npolitical science, and law, constantly survived this change.\"\\n\\n\"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice,\\netc. that are common to all states of society. But Communism\\nabolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all\\nmorality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it\\ntherefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\"\\n\\nWhat does this accusation reduce itself to?  The history of\\nall past society has consisted in the development of class\\nantagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at\\ndifferent epochs.\\n\\nBut whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all\\npast ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the\\nother. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past\\nages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays,\\nmoves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which\\ncannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of\\nclass antagonisms.\\n\\nThe Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with\\ntraditional property relations; no wonder that its development\\ninvolves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\\n\\nBut let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\\n\\nWe have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the\\nworking class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of\\nruling as to win the battle of democracy.\\n\\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by\\ndegrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all\\ninstruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the\\nproletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the\\ntotal of productive forces as rapidly as possible.\\n\\nOf course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by\\nmeans of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on\\nthe conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,\\ntherefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable,\\nbut which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,\\nnecessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are\\nunavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of\\nproduction.\\n\\nThese measures will of course be different in different\\ncountries.\\n\\nNevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will\\nbe pretty generally applicable.\\n\\n1.  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents\\n    of land to public purposes.\\n\\n2.  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\\n\\n3.  Abolition of all right of inheritance.\\n\\n4.  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\\n\\n5.  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means\\n    of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive\\n    monopoly.\\n\\n6.  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport\\n    in the hands of the State.\\n\\n7.  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by\\n    the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and\\n    the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a\\n    common plan.\\n\\n8.  Equal liability of all to labour.  Establishment of\\n    industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\\n\\n9.  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;\\n    gradual abolition of the distinction between town and\\n    country, by a more equable distribution of the population\\n    over the country.\\n\\n10. Free education for all children in public schools.\\n    Abolition of children\\'s factory labour in its present form.\\n    Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.\\n\\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions have\\ndisappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the\\nhands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power\\nwill lose its political character.  Political power, properly so\\ncalled, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing\\nanother.  If the proletariat during its contest with the\\nbourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to\\norganise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it\\nmakes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force\\nthe old conditions of production, then it will, along with these\\nconditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of\\nclass antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have\\nabolished its own supremacy as a class.\\n\\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and\\nclass antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which\\nthe free development of each is the condition for the free\\ndevelopment of all.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.  SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE\\n\\n\\n1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM\\n\\n\\nA. Feudal Socialism\\n\\nOwing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the\\naristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against\\nmodern bourgeois society.  In the French revolution of July 1830,\\nand in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again\\nsuccumbed to the hateful upstart.  Thenceforth, a serious political\\ncontest was altogether out of the question.  A literary battle\\nalone remained possible.  But even in the domain of literature\\nthe old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.\\n\\nIn order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to\\nlose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate\\ntheir indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the\\nexploited working class alone.  Thus the aristocracy took their\\nrevenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering\\nin his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.\\n\\nIn this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half\\nlampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at\\ntimes, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the\\nbourgeoisie to the very heart\\'s core; but always ludicrous in\\nits effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of\\nmodern history.\\n\\nThe aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the\\nproletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  But the people, so\\noften as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal\\ncoats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.\\n\\nOne section of the French Legitimists and \"Young England\"\\nexhibited this spectacle.\\n\\nIn pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to\\nthat of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they\\nexploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite\\ndifferent, and that are now antiquated.  In showing that, under\\ntheir rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget\\nthat the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their\\nown form of society.\\n\\nFor the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary\\ncharacter of their criticism that their chief accusation against\\nthe bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime\\na class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and\\nbranch the old order of society.\\n\\nWhat they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it\\ncreates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary\\nproletariat.\\n\\nIn political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive\\nmeasures against the working class; and in ordinary life,\\ndespite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the\\ngolden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter\\ntruth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and\\npotato spirits.\\n\\nAs the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord,\\nso has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.\\n\\nNothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist\\ntinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property,\\nagainst marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the\\nplace of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification\\nof the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian\\nSocialism is but the holy, water with which the priest consecrates\\nthe heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\\n\\n\\nB. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\\n\\nThe feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by\\nthe bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence\\npined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society.\\nThe mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were\\nthe precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.  In those countries\\nwhich are but little developed, industrially and commercially,\\nthese two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\nIn countries where modern civilisation has become fully\\ndeveloped, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,\\nfluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing\\nitself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.  The\\nindividual members of this class, however, are being constantly\\nhurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition,\\nand, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment\\napproaching when they will completely disappear as an independent\\nsection of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures,\\nagriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.\\n\\nIn countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more\\nthan half of the population, it was natural that writers who\\nsided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,\\nin their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the\\npeasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these\\nintermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working\\nclass.  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.  Sismondi was the\\nhead of this school, not only in France but also in England.\\n\\nThis school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the\\ncontradictions in the conditions of modern production.  It laid\\nbare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  It proved,\\nincontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and\\ndivision of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a\\nfew hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the\\ninevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery\\nof the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying\\ninequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of\\nextermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral\\nbonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.\\n\\nIn its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires\\neither to restoring the old means of production and of exchange,\\nand with them the old property relations, and the old society, or\\nto cramping the modern means of production and of exchange,\\nwithin the framework of the old property relations that have\\nbeen, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  In either\\ncase, it is both reactionary and Utopian.\\n\\nIts last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture,\\npatriarchal relations in agriculture.\\n\\nUltimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all\\nintoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism\\nended in a miserable fit of the blues.\\n\\n\\nC. German, or \"True,\" Socialism\\n\\nThe Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature\\nthat originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and\\nthat was the expression of the struggle against this power, was\\nintroduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that\\ncountry, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.\\n\\nGerman philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits,\\neagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when\\nthese writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social\\nconditions had not immigrated along with them.  In contact with\\nGerman social conditions, this French literature lost all its\\nimmediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary\\naspect.  Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth\\ncentury, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing\\nmore than the demands of \"Practical Reason\" in general, and the\\nutterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie\\nsignified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was\\nbound to be, of true human Will generally.\\n\\nThe world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing\\nthe new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical\\nconscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without\\ndeserting their own philosophic point of view.\\n\\nThis annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign\\nlanguage is appropriated, namely, by translation.\\n\\nIt is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic\\nSaints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of\\nancient heathendom had been written.  The German literate\\nreversed this process with the profane French literature.  They\\nwrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.\\nFor instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic\\nfunctions of money, they wrote \"Alienation of Humanity,\" and\\nbeneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote\\n\"dethronement of the Category of the General,\" and so forth.\\n\\nThe introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of\\nthe French historical criticisms they dubbed \"Philosophy of\\nAction,\" \"True Socialism,\" \"German Science of Socialism,\"\\n\"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,\" and so on.\\n\\nThe French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely\\nemasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express\\nthe struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having\\novercome \"French one-sidedness\" and of representing, not true\\nrequirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the\\nproletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who\\nbelongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm\\nof philosophical fantasy.\\n\\nThis German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously\\nand solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such\\nmountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic\\ninnocence.\\n\\nThe fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie,\\nagainst feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the\\nliberal movement, became more earnest.\\n\\nBy this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to \"True\"\\nSocialism of confronting the political movement with the\\nSocialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas\\nagainst liberalism, against representative government, against\\nbourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois\\nlegislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to\\nthe masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose,\\nby this bourgeois movement.  German Socialism forgot, in the nick\\nof time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was,\\npresupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its\\ncorresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political\\nconstitution adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment\\nwas the object of the pending struggle in Germany.\\n\\nTo the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,\\nprofessors, country squires and officials, it served as a welcome\\nscarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\\n\\nIt was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and\\nbullets with which these same governments, just at that time,\\ndosed the German working-class risings.\\n\\nWhile this \"True\" Socialism thus served the governments as a\\nweapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time,\\ndirectly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the\\nGerman Philistines.  In Germany the petty-bourgeois class, a\\nrelic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly\\ncropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis\\nof the existing state of things.\\n\\nTo preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of\\nthings in Germany.  The industrial and political supremacy of the\\nbourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction; on the one\\nhand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the\\nrise of a revolutionary proletariat.  \"True\" Socialism appeared to\\nkill these two birds with one stone.  It spread like an epidemic.\\n\\nThe robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers\\nof rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this\\ntranscendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their\\nsorry \"eternal truths,\" all skin and bone, served to wonderfully\\nincrease the sale of their goods amongst such a public.  And on\\nits part, German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own\\ncalling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois\\nPhilistine.\\n\\nIt proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the\\nGerman petty Philistine to be the typical man.  To every\\nvillainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden, higher,\\nSocialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real\\ncharacter.  It went to the extreme length of directly opposing\\nthe \"brutally destructive\" tendency of Communism, and of\\nproclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class\\nstruggles.  With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist\\nand Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany\\nbelong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.\\n\\n\\n2. CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM\\n\\nA part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social\\ngrievances, in order to secure the continued existence of\\nbourgeois society.\\n\\nTo this section belong economists, philanthropists,\\nhumanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class,\\norganisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of\\ncruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner\\nreformers of every imaginable kind.  This form of Socialism has,\\nmoreover, been worked out into complete systems.\\n\\nWe may cite Proudhon\\'s Philosophie de la Misere as an example of\\nthis form.\\n\\nThe Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern\\nsocial conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily\\nresulting therefrom.  They desire the existing state of society\\nminus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements.  They wish\\nfor a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.  The bourgeoisie\\nnaturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the\\nbest; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable\\nconception into various more or less complete systems.  In\\nrequiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby\\nto march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but\\nrequires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within\\nthe bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its\\nhateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.\\n\\nA second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this\\nSocialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in\\nthe eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political\\nreform, but only a change in the material conditions of\\nexistence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to\\nthem.  By changes in the material conditions of existence, this\\nform of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of\\nthe bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be\\neffected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based\\non the continued existence of these relations; reforms,\\ntherefore, that in no respect affect the relations between\\ncapital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and\\nsimplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\\n\\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only\\nwhen, it becomes a mere figure of speech.\\n\\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class.  Protective\\nduties: for the benefit of the working class.  Prison Reform: for\\nthe benefit of the working class.  This is the last word and the\\nonly seriously meant word of bourgeois Socialism.\\n\\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois--for\\nthe benefit of the working class.\\n\\n\\n3.  CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM\\n\\nWe do not here refer to that literature which, in every great\\nmodern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the\\nproletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\\n\\nThe first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own\\nends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society\\nwas being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing\\nto the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to\\nthe absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation,\\nconditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced\\nby the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary\\nliterature that accompanied these first movements of the\\nproletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It\\ninculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its\\ncrudest form.\\n\\nThe Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of\\nSaint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others, spring into existence in\\nthe early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle\\nbetween proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois\\nand Proletarians).\\n\\nThe founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as\\nwell as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form\\nof society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them\\nthe spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any\\nindependent political movement.\\n\\nSince the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with\\nthe development of industry, the economic situation, as they find\\nit, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the\\nemancipation of the proletariat.  They therefore search after a\\nnew social science, after new social laws, that are to create\\nthese conditions.\\n\\nHistorical action is to yield to their personal inventive\\naction, historically created conditions of emancipation to\\nfantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation\\nof the proletariat to the organisation of society specially\\ncontrived by these inventors.  Future history resolves itself, in\\ntheir eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of\\ntheir social plans.\\n\\nIn the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring\\nchiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most\\nsuffering class.  Only from the point of view of being the most\\nsuffering class does the proletariat exist for them.\\n\\nThe undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their\\nown surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider\\nthemselves far superior to all class antagonisms.  They want to\\nimprove the condition of every member of society, even that of\\nthe most favoured.  Hence, they habitually appeal to society at\\nlarge, without  distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the\\nruling class.  For how can people, when once they understand\\ntheir system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the\\nbest possible state of society?\\n\\nHence, they reject all political, and especially all\\nrevolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by\\npeaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily\\ndoomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way\\nfor the new social Gospel.\\n\\nSuch fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time\\nwhen the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has\\nbut a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with\\nthe first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general\\nreconstruction of society.\\n\\nBut these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a\\ncritical element. They attack every principle of existing society.\\nHence they are full of the most valuable materials for the\\nenlightenment of the working class. The practical measures\\nproposed in them--such as the abolition of the distinction\\nbetween town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of\\nindustries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage\\nsystem, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the\\nfunctions of the State into a mere superintendence of production,\\nall these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class\\nantagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and\\nwhich, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest,\\nindistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore,\\nare of a purely Utopian character.\\n\\nThe significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism\\nbears an inverse relation to historical development.  In\\nproportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes\\ndefinite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest,\\nthese fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all\\ntheoretical justification.  Therefore, although the originators\\nof these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their\\ndisciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects.\\nThey hold fast by the original views of their masters, in\\nopposition to the progressive historical development of the\\nproletariat.  They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently,\\nto deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.\\nThey still dream of experimental realisation of their social\\nUtopias, of founding isolated \"phalansteres,\" of establishing\\n\"Home Colonies,\"  of setting up a \"Little Icaria\"--duodecimo\\neditions of the New Jerusalem--and to realise all these castles\\nin the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and\\npurses of the bourgeois.  By degrees they sink into the category\\nof the reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above,\\ndiffering from these only by more systematic pedantry, and\\nby their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous\\neffects of their social science.\\n\\nThey, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the\\npart of the working class; such action, according to them, can\\nonly result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\\n\\nThe Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France,\\nrespectively, oppose the Chartists and the Reformistes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.  POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE\\nVARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES\\n\\nSection II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the\\nexisting working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England\\nand the Agrarian Reformers in America.\\n\\nThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims,\\nfor the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working\\nclass; but in the movement of the present, they also represent\\nand take care of the future of that movement.  In France the\\nCommunists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the\\nconservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the\\nright to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and\\nillusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\\n\\nIn Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight\\nof the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements,\\npartly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of\\nradical bourgeois.\\n\\nIn Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian\\nrevolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that\\nparty which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\\n\\nIn Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a\\nrevolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal\\nsquirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\\n\\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the\\nworking class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile\\nantagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the\\nGerman workers may straightaway use, as so many weapons against\\nthe bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the\\nbourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy,\\nand in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in\\nGermany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately\\nbegin.\\n\\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because\\nthat country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that\\nis bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions\\nof European civilisation, and with a much more developed\\nproletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of\\nFrance in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois\\nrevolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately\\nfollowing proletarian revolution.\\n\\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary\\nmovement against the existing social and political order of\\nthings.\\n\\nIn all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading\\nquestion in each, the property question, no matter what its\\ndegree of development at the time.\\n\\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of\\nthe democratic parties of all countries.\\n\\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.\\nThey openly declare that their ends can be attained only by\\nthe forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.\\nLet the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.\\nThe proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.\\nThey have a world to win.\\n\\n\\n           WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Communist Manifesto\\nby Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 61.txt or 61.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/6/61/\\n\\nTranscribed by Allen Lutins with assistance from Jim Tarzia.\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

ALCOTT.\\n\\nSEPTEMBER, 1887.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMAY FLOWERS\\n\\n\\nBeing Boston girls, of course they got up a club for mental\\nimprovement, and, as they were all descendants of the Pilgrim\\nFathers, they called it the Mayflower Club. A very good name, and\\nthe six young girls who were members of it made a very pretty posy\\nwhen they met together, once a week, to sew, and read well-chosen\\nbooks. At the first meeting of the season, after being separated all\\nsummer, there was a good deal of gossip to be attended to before the\\nquestion, “What shall we read?” came up for serious discussion.\\n\\nAnna Winslow, as president, began by proposing “Happy Dodd;” but a\\nchorus of “I’ve read it!” made her turn to her list for another\\ntitle.\\n\\n“‘Prisoners of Poverty’ is all about workingwomen, very true and\\nvery sad; but Mamma said it might do us good to know something of\\nthe hard times other girls have,” said Anna, soberly; for she was a\\nthoughtful creature, very anxious to do her duty in all ways.\\n\\n“I’d rather not know about sad things, since I can’t help to make\\nthem any better,” answered Ella Carver, softly patting the apple\\nblossoms she was embroidering on a bit of blue satin.\\n\\n“But we might help if we really tried, I suppose; you know how much\\nHappy Dodd did when she once began, and she was only a poor little\\ngirl without half the means of doing good which we have,” said Anna,\\nglad to discuss the matter, for she had a little plan in her head\\nand wanted to prepare a way for proposing it.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m always saying that I have more than my share of fun and\\ncomfort and pretty things, and that I ought and will share them with\\nsome one. But I don’t do it; and now and then, when I hear about\\nreal poverty, or dreadful sickness, I feel so wicked it quite upsets\\nme. If I knew HOW to begin, I really would. But dirty little\\nchildren don’t come in my way, nor tipsy women to be reformed, nor\\nnice lame girls to sing and pray with, as it all happens in books,”\\n cried Marion Warren, with such a remorseful expression on her merry\\nround face that her mates laughed with one accord.\\n\\n“I know something that I COULD do if I only had the courage to begin\\nit. But Papa would shake his head unbelievingly, and Mamma worry\\nabout its being proper, and it would interfere with my music, and\\neverything nice that I especially wanted to go to would be sure\\nto come on whatever day I set for my good work, and I should get\\ndiscouraged or ashamed, and not half do it, so I don’t begin, but I\\nknow I ought.” And Elizabeth Alden rolled her large eyes from one\\nfriend to another, as if appealing to them to goad her to this duty\\nby counsel and encouragement of some sort.\\n\\n“Well, I suppose it’s right, but I do perfectly hate to go poking\\nround among poor folks, smelling bad smells, seeing dreadful sights,\\nhearing woful tales, and running the risk of catching fever, and\\ndiphtheria, and horrid things. I don’t pretend to like charity, but\\nsay right out I’m a silly, selfish wretch, and want to enjoy every\\nminute, and not worry about other people. Isn’t it shameful?”\\n\\nMaggie Bradford looked such a sweet little sinner as she boldly made\\nthis sad confession, that no one could scold her, though Ida\\nStandish, her bosom friend, shook her head, and Anna said, with a\\nsigh: “I’m afraid we all feel very much as Maggie does, though we\\ndon’t own it so honestly. Last spring, when I was ill and thought I\\nmight die, I was so ashamed of my idle, frivolous winter, that I\\nfelt as if I’d give all I had to be able to live it over and do\\nbetter. Much is not expected of a girl of eighteen, I know; but oh!\\nthere were heaps of kind little things I MIGHT have done if I hadn’t\\nthought only of myself. I resolved if I lived I’d try at least to be\\nless selfish, and make some one happier for my being in the world. I\\ntell you, girls, it’s rather solemn when you lie expecting to die,\\nand your sins come up before you, even though they are very small\\nones. I never shall forget it, and after my lovely summer I mean to\\nbe a better girl, and lead a better life if I can.”\\n\\nAnna was so much in earnest that her words, straight out of a very\\ninnocent and contrite heart, touched her hearers deeply, and put\\nthem into the right mood to embrace her proposition. No one spoke\\nfor a moment, then Maggie said quietly,--\\n\\n“I know what it is. I felt very much so when the horses ran away,\\nand for fifteen minutes I sat clinging to Mamma, expecting to be\\nkilled. Every unkind, undutiful word I’d ever said to her came back\\nto me, and was worse to bear than the fear of sudden death. It\\nscared a great deal of naughtiness out of me, and dear Mamma and I\\nhave been more to each other ever since.”\\n\\n“Let us begin with ‘The Prisoners of Poverty,’ and perhaps it will\\nshow us something to do,” said Lizzie. “But I must say I never felt\\nas if shop-girls needed much help; they generally seem so contented\\nwith themselves, and so pert or patronizing to us, that I don’t pity\\nthem a bit, though it must be a hard life.”\\n\\n“I think we can’t do MUCH in that direction, except set an example\\nof good manners when we go shopping. I wanted to propose that we\\neach choose some small charity for this winter, and do it\\nfaithfully. That will teach us how to do more by and by, and we can\\nhelp one another with our experiences, perhaps, or amuse with our\\nfailures. What do you say?” asked Anna, surveying her five friends\\nwith a persuasive smile.\\n\\n“What COULD we do?”\\n\\n“People will call us goody-goody.”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea how to go to work.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mamma will let me.”\\n\\n“We’d better change our names from May Flowers to sisters of\\ncharity, and wear meek black bonnets and flapping cloaks.”\\n\\nAnna received these replies with great composure, and waited for the\\nmeeting to come to order, well knowing that the girls would have\\ntheir fun and outcry first, and then set to work in good earnest.\\n\\n“I think it’s a lovely idea, and I’ll carry out my plan. But I won’t\\ntell what it is yet; you’d all shout, and say I couldn’t do it, but\\nif you were trying also, that would keep me up to the mark,” said\\nLizzie, with a decided snap of her scissors, as she trimmed the\\nedges of a plush case for her beloved music.\\n\\n“Suppose we all keep our attempts secret, and not let our right hand\\nknow what the left hand does? It’s such fun to mystify people, and\\nthen no one can laugh at us. If we fail, we can say nothing; if we\\nsucceed, we can tell of it and get our reward. I’d like that way,\\nand will look round at once for some especially horrid boot-black,\\nungrateful old woman, or ugly child, and devote myself to him, her,\\nor it with the patience of a saint,” cried Maggie, caught by the\\nidea of doing good in secret and being found out by accident.\\n\\nThe other girls agreed, after some discussion, and then Anna took\\nthe floor again.\\n\\n“I propose that we each work in our own way till next May, then, at\\nour last meeting, report what we have done, truly and honestly, and\\nplan something better for next year. Is it a vote?”\\n\\nIt evidently was a unanimous vote, for five gold thimbles went up,\\nand five blooming faces smiled as the five girlish voices cried,\\n“Aye!”\\n\\n“Very well, now let us decide what to read, and begin at once. I\\nthink the ‘Prisoners’ a good book, and we shall doubtless get some\\nhints from it.”\\n\\nSo they began, and for an hour one pleasant voice after the other\\nread aloud those sad, true stories of workingwomen and their hard\\nlives, showing these gay young creatures what their pretty clothes\\ncost the real makers of them, and how much injustice, suffering, and\\nwasted strength went into them. It was very sober reading, but most\\nabsorbing; for the crochet needles went slower and slower, the\\nlace-work lay idle, and a great tear shone like a drop of dew on the\\napple blossoms as Ella listened to “Rose’s Story.” They skipped the\\nstatistics, and dipped here and there as each took her turn; but\\nwhen the two hours were over, and it was time for the club to\\nadjourn, all the members were deeply interested in that pathetic\\nbook, and more in earnest than before; for this glimpse into other\\nlives showed them how much help was needed, and made them anxious to\\nlend a hand.\\n\\n“We can’t do much, being ‘only girls,’” said Anna; “but if each does\\none small chore somewhere it will pave the way for better work; so\\nwe will all try, at least, though it seems like so many ants trying\\nto move a mountain.”\\n\\n“Well, ants build nests higher than a man’s head in Africa; you\\nremember the picture of them in our old geographies? And we can do\\nas much, I’m sure, if each tugs her pebble or straw faithfully. I\\nshall shoulder mine to-morrow if Mamma is willing,” answered Lizzie,\\nshutting up her work-bag as if she had her resolution inside and was\\nafraid it might evaporate before she got home.\\n\\n“I shall stand on the Common, and proclaim aloud, ‘Here’s a nice\\nyoung missionary, in want of a job! Charity for sale cheap! Who’ll\\nbuy? who’ll buy?’” said Maggie, with a resigned expression, and a\\nsanctimonious twang to her voice.\\n\\n“I shall wait and see what comes to me, since I don’t know what I’m\\nfit for;” and Marion gazed out of the window as if expecting to see\\nsome interesting pauper waiting for her to appear.\\n\\n“I shall ask Miss Bliss for advice; she knows all about the poor,\\nand will give me a good start,” added prudent Ida, who resolved to\\ndo nothing rashly lest she should fail.\\n\\n“I shall probably have a class of dirty little girls, and teach them\\nhow to sew, as I can’t do anything else. They won’t learn much, but\\nsteal, and break, and mess, and be a dreadful trial, and I shall get\\nlaughed at and wish I hadn’t done it. Still I shall try it, and\\nsacrifice my fancy-work to the cause of virtue,” said Ella,\\ncarefully putting away her satin glove-case with a fond glance at\\nthe delicate flowers she so loved to embroider.\\n\\n“I have no plans, but want to do so much! I shall have to wait till\\nI discover what is best. After to-day we won’t speak of our work, or\\nit won’t be a secret any longer. In May we will report. Good luck to\\nall, and good-by till next Saturday.”\\n\\nWith these farewell words from their president the girls departed,\\nwith great plans and new ideas simmering in their young heads and\\nhearts.\\n\\nIt seemed a vast undertaking; but where there is a will there is\\nalways a way, and soon it was evident that each had found “a little\\nchore” to do for sweet charity’s sake. Not a word was said at the\\nweekly meetings, but the artless faces betrayed all shades of hope,\\ndiscouragement, pride, and doubt, as their various attempts seemed\\nlikely to succeed or fail. Much curiosity was felt, and a few\\naccidental words, hints, or meetings in queer places, were very\\nexciting, though nothing was discovered.\\n\\nMarion was often seen in a North End car, and Lizzie in a South End\\ncar, with a bag of books and papers. Ella haunted a certain shop\\nwhere fancy articles were sold, and Ida always brought plain sewing\\nto the club. Maggie seemed very busy at home, and Anna was found\\nwriting industriously several times when one of her friends called.\\nAll seemed very happy, and rather important when outsiders\\nquestioned them about their affairs. But they had their pleasures as\\nusual, and seemed to enjoy them with an added relish, as if they\\nrealized as never before how many blessings they possessed, and were\\ngrateful for them.\\n\\nSo the winter passed, and slowly something new and pleasant seemed\\nto come into the lives of these young girls. The listless,\\ndiscontented look some of them used to wear passed away; a sweet\\nearnestness and a cheerful activity made them charming, though they\\ndid not know it, and wondered when people said, “That set of girls\\nare growing up beautifully; they will make fine women by and by.”\\n The mayflowers were budding under the snow, and as spring came on\\nthe fresh perfume began to steal out, the rosy faces to brighten,\\nand the last year’s dead leaves to fall away, leaving the young\\nplants green and strong.\\n\\nOn the 15th of May the club met for the last time that season, as\\nsome left town early, and all were full of spring work and summer\\nplans. Every member was in her place at an unusually early hour that\\nday, and each wore an air of mingled anxiety, expectation, and\\nsatisfaction, pleasant to behold. Anna called them to order with\\nthree raps of her thimble and a beaming smile.\\n\\n“We need not choose a book for our reading to-day, as each of us is\\nto contribute an original history of her winter’s work. I know it\\nwill be very interesting, and I hope more instructive, than some of\\nthe novels we have read. Who shall begin?”\\n\\n“You! you!” was the unanimous answer; for all loved and respected\\nher very much, and felt that their presiding officer should open the\\nball.\\n\\nAnna colored modestly, but surprised her friends by the composure\\nwith which she related her little story, quite as if used to public\\nspeaking.\\n\\n“You know I told you last November that I should have to look about\\nfor something that I COULD do. I did look a long time, and was\\nrather in despair, when my task came to me in the most unexpected\\nway. Our winter work was being done, so I had a good deal of\\nshopping on my hands, and found it less a bore than usual, because I\\nliked to watch the shop-girls, and wish I dared ask some of them if\\nI could help them. I went often to get trimmings and buttons at\\nCotton’s, and had a good deal to do with the two girls at that\\ncounter. They were very obliging and patient about matching some jet\\nornaments for Mamma, and I found out that their names were Mary and\\nMaria Porter. I liked them, for they were very neat and plain in\\ntheir dress,--not like some, who seem to think that if their waists\\nare small, and their hair dressed in the fashion, it is no matter\\nhow soiled their collars are, nor how untidy their nails. Well, one\\nday when I went for certain kinds of buttons which were to be made\\nfor us, Maria, the younger one, who took the order, was not there. I\\nasked for her, and Mary said she was at home with a lame knee. I was\\nso sorry, and ventured to put a few questions in a friendly way.\\nMary seemed glad to tell her troubles, and I found that ‘Ria,’ as\\nshe called her sister, had been suffering for a long time, but did\\nnot complain for fear of losing her place. No stools are allowed at\\nCotton’s, so the poor girls stand nearly all day, or rest a minute\\nnow and then on a half-opened drawer. I’d seen Maria doing it, and\\nwondered why some one did not make a stir about seats in this place,\\nas they have in other stores and got stools for the shop women. I\\ndidn’t dare to speak to the gentlemen, but I gave Mary the Jack\\nroses I wore in my breast, and asked if I might take some books or\\nflowers to poor Maria. It was lovely to see her sad face light up\\nand hear her thank me when I went to see her, for she was very\\nlonely without her sister, and discouraged about her place. She did\\nnot lose it entirely, but had to work at home, for her lame knee\\nwill be a long time in getting well. I begged Mamma and Mrs.\\nAilingham to speak to Mr. Cotton for her; so she got the mending of\\nthe jet and bead work to do, and buttons to cover, and things of\\nthat sort. Mary takes them to and fro, and Maria feels so happy not\\nto be idle. We also got stools, for all the other girls in that\\nshop. Mrs. Allingham is so rich and kind she can do anything, and\\nnow it’s such a comfort to see those tired things resting when off\\nduty that I often go in and enjoy the sight.”\\n\\nAnna paused as cries of “Good! good!” interrupted her tale; but she\\ndid not add the prettiest part of it, and tell how the faces of the\\nyoung women behind the counters brightened when she came in, nor how\\ngladly all served the young lady who showed them what a true\\ngentlewoman was.\\n\\n“I hope that isn’t all?” said Maggie, eagerly.\\n\\n“Only a little more. I know you will laugh when I tell you that I’ve\\nbeen reading papers to a class of shop-girls at the Union once a\\nweek all winter.”\\n\\nA murmur of awe and admiration greeted this deeply interesting\\nstatement; for, true to the traditions of the modern Athens in which\\nthey lived, the girls all felt the highest respect for “papers” on\\nany subject, it being the fashion for ladies, old and young, to read\\nand discuss every subject, from pottery to Pantheism, at the various\\nclubs all over the city.\\n\\n“It came about very naturally,” continued Anna, as if anxious to\\nexplain her seeming audacity. “I used to go to see Molly and Ria,\\nand heard all about their life and its few pleasures, and learned to\\nlike them more and more. They had only each other in the world,\\nlived in two rooms, worked all day, and in the way of amusement or\\ninstruction had only what they found at the Union in the evening. I\\nwent with them a few times, and saw how useful and pleasant it was,\\nand wanted to help, as other kind girls only a little older than I\\ndid. Eva Randal read a letter from a friend in Russia one time, and\\nthe girls enjoyed it very much. That reminded me of my brother\\nGeorge’s lively journals, written when he was abroad. You remember\\nhow we used to laugh over them when he sent them home? Well, when I\\nwas begged to give them an evening, I resolved to try one of those\\namusing journal-letters, and chose the best,--all about how George\\nand a friend went to the different places Dickens describes in some\\nof his funny books. I wish you could have seen how those dear girls\\nenjoyed it, and laughed till they cried over the dismay of the boys,\\nwhen they knocked at a door in Kingsgate Street, and asked if Mrs.\\nGamp lived there. It was actually a barber’s shop, and a little man,\\nvery like Poll Sweedlepipes, told them ‘Mrs. Britton was the nuss as\\nlived there now.’ It upset those rascals to come so near the truth,\\nand they ran away because they couldn’t keep sober.”\\n\\nThe members of the club indulged in a general smile as they recalled\\nthe immortal Sairey with “the bottle on the mankle-shelf,” the\\n“cowcuber,” and the wooden pippins. Then Anna continued, with an air\\nof calm satisfaction, quite sure now of her audience and herself,--\\n\\n“It was a great success. So I went on, and when the journals were\\ndone, I used to read other things, and picked up books for their\\nlibrary, and helped in any way I could, while learning to know them\\nbetter and give them confidence in me. They are proud and shy, just\\nas we should be but if you REALLY want to be friends and don’t mind\\nrebuffs now and then, they come to trust and like you, and there is\\nso much to do for them one never need sit idle any more. I won’t\\ngive names, as they don’t like it, nor tell how I tried to serve\\nthem, but it is very sweet and good for me to have found this work,\\nand to know that each year I can do it better and better. So I feel\\nencouraged and am very glad I began, as I hope you all are. Now, who\\ncomes next?”\\n\\nAs Anna ended, the needles dropped and ten soft hands gave her a\\nhearty round of applause; for all felt that she had done well, and\\nchosen a task especially fitted to her powers, as she had money,\\ntime, tact, and the winning manners that make friends everywhere.\\n\\nBeaming with pleasure at their approval, but feeling that they made\\ntoo much of her small success, Anna called the club to order by\\nsaying, “Ella looks as if she were anxious to tell her experiences,\\nso perhaps we had better ask her to hold forth next.”\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried the girls; and, nothing loath, Ella promptly\\nbegan, with twinkling eyes and a demure smile, for HER story ended\\nromantically.\\n\\n“If you are interested in shop-girls, Miss President and ladies, you\\nwill like to know that _I_ am one, at least a silent partner and\\nco-worker in a small fancy store at the West End.”\\n\\n“No!” exclaimed the amazed club with one voice; and, satisfied with\\nthis sensational beginning Ella went on.\\n\\n“I really am, and you have bought some of my fancy-work. Isn’t that\\na good joke? You needn’t stare so, for I actually made that\\nneedle-book, Anna, and my partner knit Lizzie’s new cloud. This is\\nthe way it all happened. I didn’t wish to waste any time, but one\\ncan’t rush into the street and collar shabby little girls, and say,\\n‘Come along and learn to sew,’ without a struggle, so I thought I’d\\ngo and ask Mrs. Brown how to begin. Her branch of the Associated\\nCharities is in Laurel Street, not far from our house, you know; and\\nthe very day after our last meeting I posted off to get my ‘chore.’\\nI expected to have to fit work for poor needlewomen, or go to see\\nsome dreadful sick creature, or wash dirty little Pats, and was\\nbracing up my mind for whatever might come, as I toiled up the hill\\nin a gale of wind. Suddenly my hat flew off and went gayly skipping\\naway, to the great delight of some black imps, who only grinned and\\ncheered me on as I trotted after it with wild grabs and wrathful\\ndodges. I got it at last out of a puddle, and there I was in a nice\\nmess. The elastic was broken, feather wet, and the poor thing all\\nmud and dirt. I didn’t care much, as it was my old one,--dressed for\\nmy work, you see. But I couldn’t go home bareheaded, and I didn’t\\nknow a soul in that neighborhood. I turned to step into a grocery\\nstore at the corner, to borrow a brush or buy a sheet of paper to\\nwear, for I looked like a lunatic with my battered hat and my hair\\nin a perfect mop. Luckily I spied a woman’s fancy shop on the other\\ncorner, and rushed in there to hide myself, for the brats hooted and\\npeople stared. It was a very small shop, and behind the counter sat\\na tall, thin, washed-out-looking woman, making a baby’s hood. She\\nlooked poor and blue and rather sour, but took pity on me; and while\\nshe sewed the cord, dried the feather, and brushed off the dirt, I\\nwarmed myself and looked about to see what I could buy in return for\\nher trouble.\\n\\n“A few children’s aprons hung in the little window, with some knit\\nlace, balls, and old-fashioned garters, two or three dolls, and a\\nvery poor display of small wares. In a show-case, however, on the\\ntable that was the counter, I found some really pretty things, made\\nof plush, silk, and ribbon, with a good deal of taste. So I said I’d\\nbuy a needle-book, and a gay ball, and a pair of distracting baby’s\\nshoes, made to look like little open-work socks with pink\\nankle-ties, so cunning and dainty, I was glad to get them for Cousin\\nClara’s baby. The woman seemed pleased, though she had a grim way of\\ntalking, and never smiled once. I observed that she handled my hat\\nas if used to such work, and evidently liked to do it. I thanked her\\nfor repairing damages so quickly and well, and she said, with my hat\\non her hand, as if she hated to part with it, ‘I’m used to\\nmillineryin’ and never should have give it up, if I didn’t have my\\nfolks to see to. I took this shop, hopin’ to make things go, as such\\na place was needed round here, but mother broke down, and is a sight\\nof care; so I couldn’t leave her, and doctors is expensive, and\\ntimes hard, and I had to drop my trade, and fall back on pins and\\nneedles, and so on.’”\\n\\nElla was a capital mimic, and imitated the nasal tones of the\\nVermont woman to the life, with a doleful pucker of her own blooming\\nface, which gave such a truthful picture of poor Miss Almira Miller\\nthat those who had seen her recognized it at once, and laughed\\ngayly.\\n\\n“Just as I was murmuring a few words of regret at her bad luck,”\\n continued Ella, “a sharp voice called out from a back room, ‘Almiry!\\nAlmiry! come here.’ It sounded very like a cross parrot, but it was\\nthe old lady, and while I put on my hat I heard her asking who was\\nin the shop, and what we were ‘gabbin’ about.’ Her daughter told\\nher, and the old soul demanded to ‘see the gal;’ so I went in, being\\nready for fun as usual. It was a little, dark, dismal place, but as\\nneat as a pin, and in the bed sat a regular Grandma Smallweed\\nsmoking a pipe, with a big cap, a snuff-box, and a red cotton\\nhandkerchief. She was a tiny, dried-up thing, brown as a berry, with\\neyes like black beads, a nose and chin that nearly met, and hands\\nlike birds’ claws. But such a fierce, lively, curious, blunt old\\nlady you never saw, and I didn’t know what would be the end of me\\nwhen she began to question, then to scold, and finally to demand\\nthat ‘folks should come and trade to Almiry’s shop after promisin’\\nthey would, and she havin’ took a lease of the place on account of\\nthem lies.’ I wanted to laugh, but dared not do it, so just let her\\ncroak, for the daughter had to go to her customers. The old lady’s\\ntirade informed me that they came from Vermont, had ‘been wal on ‘t\\ntill father died and the farm was sold.’ Then it seems the women\\ncame to Boston and got on pretty well till ‘a stroke of numb-palsy,’\\nwhatever that is, made the mother helpless and kept Almiry at home\\nto care for her. I can’t tell you how funny and yet how sad it was\\nto see the poor old soul, so full of energy and yet so helpless, and\\nthe daughter so discouraged with her pathetic little shop and no\\ncustomers to speak of. I did not know what to say till ‘Grammer\\nMiller,’ as the children call her, happened to say, when she took up\\nher knitting after the lecture, ‘If folks who go spendin’ money\\nreckless on redic’lus toys for Christmas only knew what nice things,\\nuseful and fancy, me and Almiry could make ef we had the goods,\\nthey’d jest come round this corner and buy ‘em, and keep me out of a\\nOld Woman’s Home and that good, hard-workin’ gal of mine out of a\\n‘sylum; for go there she will ef she don’t get a boost somehow, with\\nrent and firin’ and vittles all on her shoulders, and me only able\\nto wag them knittin’-needles.’\\n\\n“‘I will buy things here, and tell all my friends about it, and I\\nhave a drawer full of pretty bits of silk and velvet and plush, that\\nI will give Miss Miller for her work, if she will let me.’ I added\\nthat, for I saw that Almiry was rather proud, and hid her troubles\\nunder a grim look.\\n\\n“That pleased the old lady, and, lowering her voice, she said, with\\na motherly sort of look in her beady eyes: ‘Seein’ as you are so\\nfriendly, I’ll tell you what frets me most, a layin’ here, a burden\\nto my darter. She kep’ company with Nathan Baxter, a master\\ncarpenter up to Westminster where we lived, and ef father hadn’t a\\ndied suddin’ they’d a ben married. They waited a number o’ years,\\nworkin’ to their trades, and we was hopin’ all would turn out wal,\\nwhen troubles come, and here we be. Nathan’s got his own folks to\\nsee to, and Almiry won’t add to HIS load with hern, nor leave me; so\\nshe give him back his ring, and jest buckled to all alone. She don’t\\nsay a word, but it’s wearin’ her to a shadder, and I can’t do a\\nthing to help, but make a few pinballs, knit garters, and kiver\\nholders. Ef she got a start in business it would cheer her up a\\nsight, and give her a kind of a hopeful prospeck, for old folks\\ncan’t live forever, and Nathan is a waitin’, faithful and true.’\\n\\n“That just finished me, for I am romantic, and do enjoy love stories\\nwith all my heart, even if the lovers are only a skinny spinster and\\na master carpenter. So I just resolved to see what I could do for\\npoor Almiry and the peppery old lady. I didn’t promise anything but\\nmy bits, and, taking the things I bought, went home to talk it over\\nwith Mamma. I found she had often got pins and tape, and such small\\nwares, at the little shop, and found it very convenient, though she\\nknew nothing about the Millers. She was willing I should help if I\\ncould, but advised going slowly, and seeing what they could do\\nfirst. We did not dare to treat them like beggars, and send them\\nmoney and clothes, and tea and sugar, as we do the Irish, for they\\nwere evidently respectable people, and proud as poor. So I took my\\nbundle of odds and ends, and Mamma added some nice large pieces of\\ndresses we had done with, and gave a fine order for aprons and\\nholders and balls for our church fair.\\n\\n“It would have done your hearts good, girls, to see those poor old\\nfaces light up as I showed my scraps, and asked if the work would be\\nready by Christmas. Grammer fairly swam in the gay colors I strewed\\nover her bed, and enjoyed them like a child, while Almiry tried to\\nbe grim, but had to give it up, as she began at once to cut out\\naprons, and dropped tears all over the muslin when her back was\\nturned to me. I didn’t know a washed-out old maid COULD be so\\npathetic.”\\n\\nElla stopped to give a regretful sigh over her past blindness, while\\nher hearers made a sympathetic murmur; for young hearts are very\\ntender, and take an innocent interest in lovers’ sorrows, no matter\\nhow humble.\\n\\n“Well, that was the beginning of it. I got so absorbed in making\\nthings go well that I didn’t look any further, but just ‘buckled to’\\nwith Miss Miller and helped run that little shop. No one knew me in\\nthat street, so I slipped in and out, and did what I liked. The old\\nlady and I got to be great friends; though she often pecked and\\ncroaked like a cross raven, and was very wearing. I kept her busy\\nwith her ‘pin-balls and knittin’-work, and supplied Almiry with\\npretty materials for the various things I found she could make. You\\nwouldn’t believe what dainty bows those long fingers could tie, what\\nravishing doll’s hats she would make out of a scrap of silk and\\nlace, or the ingenious things she concocted with cones and shells\\nand fans and baskets. I love such work, and used to go and help her\\noften, for I wanted her window and shop to be full for Christmas,\\nand lure in plenty of customers. Our new toys and the little cases\\nof sewing silk sold well, and people began to come more, after I\\nlent Almiry some money to lay in a stock of better goods. Papa\\nenjoyed my business venture immensely, and was never tired of joking\\nabout it. He actually went and bought balls for four small black\\nboys who were gluing their noses to the window one day, spellbound\\nby the orange, red, and blue treasures displayed there. He liked my\\npartner’s looks, though he teased me by saying that we’d better add\\nlemonade to our stock, as poor, dear Almiry’s acid face would make\\nlemons unnecessary, and sugar and water were cheap.\\n\\n“Well, Christmas came, and we did a great business, for Mamma came\\nand sent others, and our fancy things were as pretty and cheaper\\nthan those at the art stores, so they went well, and the Millers\\nwere cheered up, and I felt encouraged, and we took a fresh start\\nafter the holidays. One of my gifts at New Year was my own\\nglove-case,--you remember the apple-blossom thing I began last\\nautumn? I put it in our window to fill up, and Mamma bought it, and\\ngave it to me full of elegant gloves, with a sweet note, and Papa\\nsent a check to ‘Miller, Warren & Co.’ I was so pleased and proud I\\ncould hardly help telling you all. But the best joke was the day you\\ngirls came in and bought our goods, and I peeped at you through the\\ncrack of the door, being in the back room dying with laughter to see\\nyou look round, and praise our ‘nice assortment of useful and pretty\\narticles.’”\\n\\n“That’s all very well, and we can bear to be laughed at if you\\nsucceeded, Miss. But I don’t believe you did, for no Millers are\\nthere now. Have you taken a palatial store on Boylston Street for\\nthis year, intending to run it alone? We’ll all patronize it, and\\nyour name will look well on a sign,” said Maggie, wondering what the\\nend of Ella’s experience had been.\\n\\n“Ah! I still have the best of it, for my romance finished up\\ndelightfully, as you shall hear. We did well all winter, and no\\nwonder. What was needed was a little ‘boost’ in the right direction,\\nand I could give it; so my Millers were much comforted, and we were\\ngood friends. But in March Grammer died suddenly, and poor Almiry\\nmourned as if she had been the sweetest mother in the world. The old\\nlady’s last wishes were to be ‘laid out harnsome in a cap with a\\npale blue satin ribbin, white wasn’t becomin’, to hev at least three\\ncarriages to the funeral, and be sure a paper with her death in it\\nwas sent to N. Baxter, Westminster, Vermont.’\\n\\n“I faithfully obeyed her commands, put on the ugly cap myself, gave\\na party of old ladies from the home a drive in the hacks, and\\ncarefully directed a marked paper to Nathan, hoping that he HAD\\nproved ‘faithful and true.’ I didn’t expect he would, so was not\\nsurprised when no answer came. But I WAS rather amazed when Almiry\\ntold me she didn’t care to keep on with the store now she was free.\\nShe wanted to visit her friends a spell this spring, and in the fall\\nwould go back to her trade in some milliner’s store.\\n\\n“I was sorry, for I really enjoyed my partnership. It seemed a\\nlittle bit ungrateful after all my trouble in getting her customers,\\nbut I didn’t say anything, and we sold out to the Widow Bates, who\\nis a good soul with six children, and will profit by our efforts.\\n\\n“Almiry bid me good-by with all the grim look gone out of her face,\\nmany thanks, and a hearty promise to write soon. That was in April.\\nA week ago I got a short letter saying,--\\n\\n“‘DEAR FRIEND,--You will be pleased to hear that I am married to Mr.\\nBaxter, and shall remain here. He was away when the paper came with\\nmother’s death, but as soon as he got home he wrote. I couldn’t make\\nup my mind till I got home and see him. Now it’s all right, and I am\\nvery happy. Many thanks for all you done for me and mother. I shall\\nnever forget it My husband sends respects, and I remain Yours\\ngratefully, ALMIRA M. BAXTER.’”\\n\\n“That’s splendid! You did well, and next winter you can look up\\nanother sour spinster and cranky old lady and make them happy,” said\\nAnna, with the approving smile all loved to receive from her.\\n\\n“My adventures are not a bit romantic, or even interesting, and yet\\nI’ve been as busy as a bee all winter, and enjoyed my work very\\nmuch,” began Elizabeth, as the President gave her a nod.\\n\\n“The plan I had in mind was to go and carry books and papers to the\\npeople in hospitals, as one of Mamma’s friends has done for years. I\\nwent once to the City Hospital with her, and it was very\\ninteresting, but I didn’t dare to go to the grown people all alone,\\nso I went to the Children’s Hospital, and soon loved to help amuse\\nthe poor little dears. I saved all the picture-books and papers I\\ncould find for them, dressed dolls, and mended toys, and got new\\nones, and made bibs and night-gowns, and felt like the mother of a\\nlarge family.\\n\\n“I had my pets, of course, and did my best for them, reading and\\nsinging and amusing them, for many suffered very much. One little\\ngirl was so dreadfully burned she could not use her hands, and would\\nlie and look at a gay dolly tied to the bedpost by the hour\\ntogether, and talk to it and love it, and died with it on her pillow\\nwhen I ‘sung lullaby’ to her for the last time. I keep it among my\\ntreasures, for I learned a lesson in patience from little Norah that\\nI never can forget.\\n\\n“Then Jimmy Dolan with hip disease was a great delight to me, for he\\nwas as gay as a lark in spite of pain, and a real little hero in the\\nway he bore the hard things that had to be done to him. He never can\\nget well, and he is at home now; but I still see to him, and he is\\nlearning to make toy furniture very nicely, so that by and by, if he\\ngets able to work at all, he may be able to learn a cabinet-maker’s\\ntrade, or some easy work.\\n\\n“But my pet of pets was Johnny, the blind boy. His poor eyes had to\\nbe taken out, and there he was left so helpless and pathetic, all\\nhis life before him, and no one to help him, for his people were\\npoor and he had to go away from the hospital since he was incurable.\\nHe seemed almost given to me, for the first time I saw him I was\\nsinging to Jimmy, when the door opened and a small boy came fumbling\\nin.\\n\\n“‘I hear a pretty voice, I want to find it,’ he said, stopping as I\\nstopped with both hands out as if begging for more.\\n\\n“‘Come on. Johnny, and the lady will sing to you like a bobolink,’\\ncalled Jimmy, as proud as Barnum showing off Jumbo.\\n\\n“The poor little thing came and stood at my knee, without stirring,\\nwhile I sang all the nursery jingles I knew. Then he put such a thin\\nlittle finger on my lips as if to feel where the music came from,\\nand said, smiling all over his white face, ‘More, please more, lots\\nof ‘em! I love it!’\\n\\n“So I sang away till I was as hoarse as a crow, and Johnny drank it\\nall in like water; kept time with his head, stamped when I gave him\\n‘Marching through Georgia,’ and hurrahed feebly in the chorus of\\n‘Red, White, and Blue.’ It was lovely to see how he enjoyed it, and\\nI was so glad I had a voice to comfort those poor babies with. He\\ncried when I had to go, and so touched my heart that I asked all\\nabout him, and resolved to get him into the Blind School as the only\\nplace where he could be taught and made happy.”\\n\\n“I thought you were bound there the day I met you, Lizzie; but you\\nlooked as solemn as if all your friends had lost their sight,” cried\\nMarion.\\n\\n“I did feel solemn, for if Johnny could not go there he would be\\nbadly off. Fortunately he was ten, and dear Mrs. Russell helped me,\\nand those good people took him in though they were crowded. ‘We\\ncannot turn one away,’ said kind Mr. Parpatharges.\\n\\n“So there my boy is, as happy as a king with his little mates,\\nlearning all sorts of useful lessons and pretty plays. He models\\nnicely in clay. Here is one of his little works. Could you do as\\nwell without eyes?” and Lizzie proudly produced a very one-sided\\npear with a long straw for a stem. “I don’t expect he will ever be a\\nsculptor, but I hope he will do something with music he loves it so,\\nand is already piping away on a fife very cleverly. Whatever his\\ngift may prove, if he lives, he will be taught to be a useful,\\nindependent man, not a helpless burden, nor an unhappy creature\\nsitting alone in the dark. I feel very happy about my lads, and am\\nsurprised to find how well I get on with them. I shall look up some\\nmore next year, for I really think I have quite a gift that way,\\nthough you wouldn’t expect it, as I have no brothers, and always had\\na fancy boys were little imps.”\\n\\nThe girls were much amused at Lizzie’s discovery of her own powers,\\nfor she was a stately damsel, who never indulged in romps, but lived\\nfor her music. Now it was evident that she had found the key to\\nunlock childish hearts, and was learning to use it, quite\\nunconscious that the sweet voice she valued so highly was much\\nimproved by the tender tones singing lullabies gave it. The fat pear\\nwas passed round like refreshments, receiving much praise and no\\nharsh criticism; and when it was safely returned to its proud\\npossessor, Ida began her tale in a lively tone.\\n\\n“I waited for MY chore, and it came tumbling down our basement steps\\none rainy day in the shape of a large dilapidated umbrella with a\\npair of small boots below it. A mild howl made me run to open the\\ndoor, for I was at lunch in the dining-room, all alone, and rather\\nblue because I couldn’t go over to see Ella. A very small girl lay\\nwith her head in a puddle at the foot of the steps, the boots waving\\nin the air, and the umbrella brooding over her like a draggled green\\nbird.\\n\\n“‘Are you hurt, child?’ said I.\\n\\n“‘No, I thank you, ma’am,’ said the mite quite calmly, as she sat up\\nand settled a woman’s shabby black hat on her head.\\n\\n“‘Did you come begging?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘No, ma’am, I came for some things Mrs. Grover’s got for us. She\\ntold me to. I don’t beg.’ And up rose the sopping thing with great\\ndignity.\\n\\n“So I asked her to sit down, and ran up to call Mrs. Grover. She was\\nbusy with Grandpa just then, and when I went back to my lunch there\\nsat my lady with her arms folded, water dripping out of the toes of\\nher old boots as they hung down from the high chair, and the biggest\\nblue eyes I ever saw fixed upon the cake and oranges on the table. I\\ngave her a piece, and she sighed with rapture, but only picked at it\\ntill I asked if she didn’t like it.\\n\\n“‘Oh yes, ‘m, it’s elegant! Only I was wishin’ I could take it to\\nCaddy and Tot, if you didn’t mind. They never had frostin’ in all\\ntheir lives, and I did once.’\\n\\n“Of course I put up a little basket of cake and oranges and figs,\\nand while Lotty feasted, we talked. I found that their mother washed\\ndishes all day in a restaurant over by the Albany Station, leaving\\nthe three children alone in the room they have on Berry Street.\\nThink of that poor thing going off before light these winter\\nmornings to stand over horrid dishes all day long, and those three\\nscraps of children alone till night! Sometimes they had a fire, and\\nwhen they hadn’t they stayed in bed. Broken food and four dollars a\\nweek was all the woman got, and on that they tried to live. Good\\nMrs. Grover happened to be nursing a poor soul near Berry Street\\nlast summer, and used to see the three little things trailing round\\nthe streets with no one to look after them.\\n\\n“Lotty is nine, though she looks about six, but is as old as most\\ngirls of fourteen, and takes good care of ‘the babies,’ as she calls\\nthe younger ones. Mrs. Grover went to see them, and, though a\\nhard-working creature, did all she could for them. This winter she\\nhas plenty of time to sew, for Grandpapa needs little done for him\\nexcept at night and morning, and that kind woman spent her own\\nmoney, and got warm flannel and cotton and stuff, and made each\\nchild a good suit. Lotty had come for hers, and when the bundle was\\nin her arms she hugged it close, and put up her little face to kiss\\nGrover so prettily, I felt that I wanted to do something too. So I\\nhunted up Min’s old waterproof and rubbers, and a hood, and sent\\nLotty home as happy as a queen, promising to go and see her. I did\\ngo, and there was my work all ready for me. Oh, girls! such a bare,\\ncold room, without a spark of fire, and no food but a pan of bits of\\npie and bread and meat, not fit for any one to eat, and in the bed,\\nwith an old carpet for cover, lay the three children. Tot and Caddy\\ncuddled in the warmest place, while Lotty, with her little blue\\nhands, was trying to patch up some old stockings with bits of\\ncotton. I didn’t know how to begin, but Lotty did, and I just took\\nher orders; for that wise little woman told me where to buy a bushel\\nof coal and some kindlings, and milk and meal, and all I wanted. I\\nworked like a beaver for an hour or two, and was so glad I’d been to\\na cooking-class, for I could make a fire, with Lotty to do the\\ngrubby part, and start a nice soup with the cold meat and potatoes,\\nand an onion or so. Soon the room was warm, and full of a nice\\nsmell, and out of bed tumbled ‘the babies,’ to dance round the stove\\nand sniff at the soup, and drink milk like hungry kittens, till I\\ncould get bread and butter ready.\\n\\n“It was great fun! and when we had cleared things up a bit, and I’d\\nput food for supper in the closet, and told Lotty to warm a bowl of\\nsoup for her mother and keep the fire going, I went home tired and\\ndirty, but very glad I’d found something to do. It is perfectly\\namazing how little poor people’s things cost, and yet they can’t get\\nthe small amount of money needed without working themselves to\\ndeath. Why, all I bought didn’t cost more than I often spend for\\nflowers, or theatre tickets, or lunches, and it made those poor\\nbabies so comfortable I could have cried to think I’d never done it\\nbefore.”\\n\\nIda paused to shake her head remorsefully, then went on with her\\nstory, sewing busily all the while on an unbleached cotton\\nnight-gown which looked about fit for a large doll.\\n\\n“I have no romantic things to tell, for poor Mrs. Kennedy was a\\nshiftless, broken-down woman, who could only ‘sozzle round,’ as Mrs.\\nGrover said, and rub along with help from any one who would lend a\\nhand. She had lived out, married young, and had no faculty about\\nanything; so when her husband died, and she was left with three\\nlittle children, it was hard to get on, with no trade, feeble\\nhealth, and a discouraged mind. She does her best, loves the girls,\\nand works hard at the only thing she can find to do; but when she\\ngives out, they will all have to part,--she to a hospital, and the\\nbabies to some home. She dreads that, and tugs away, trying to keep\\ntogether and get ahead. Thanks to Mrs. Grover, who is very sensible,\\nand knows how to help poor people, we have made things comfortable,\\nand the winter has gone nicely.\\n\\n“The mother has got work nearer home, Lotty and Caddy go to school,\\nand Tot is safe and warm, with Miss Parsons to look after her. Miss\\nParsons is a young woman who was freezing and starving in a little\\nroom upstairs, too proud to beg and too shy and sick to get much\\nwork. I found her warming her hands one day in Mrs. Kennedy’s room,\\nand hanging over the soup-pot as if she was eating the smell. It\\nreminded me of the picture in Punch where the two beggar boys look\\nin at a kitchen, sniffing at the nice dinner cooking there. One\\nsays, ‘I don’t care for the meat, Bill, but I don’t mind if I takes\\na smell at the pudd’n’ when it’s dished.’ I proposed a lunch at\\nonce, and we all sat down, and ate soup out of yellow bowls with\\npewter spoons with such a relish it was fun to see. I had on my old\\nrig; so poor Parsons thought I was some dressmaker or work-girl, and\\nopened her heart to me as she never would have done if I’d gone and\\ndemanded her confidence, and patronized her, as some people do when\\nthey want to help. I promised her some work, and proposed that she\\nshould do it in Mrs. K.’s room, as a favor, mind you, so that the\\nolder girls could go to school and Tot have some one to look after\\nher. She agreed, and that saved her fire, and made the K.’s all\\nright. Sarah (that’s Miss P.) tried to stiffen up when she learned\\nwhere I lived; but she wanted the work, and soon found I didn’t put\\non airs, but lent her books, and brought her and Tot my bouquets and\\nfavors after a german, and told her pleasant things as she sat\\ncooking her poor chilblainy feet in the oven, as if she never could\\nget thawed out.\\n\\n“This summer the whole batch are to go to Uncle Frank’s farm and\\npick berries, and get strong. He hires dozens of women and children\\nduring the fruit season, and Mrs. Grover said it was just what they\\nall needed. So off they go in June, as merry as grigs, and I shall\\nbe able to look after them now and then, as I always go to the farm\\nin July. That’s all,--not a bit interesting, but it came to me, and\\nI did it, though only a small chore.”\\n\\n“I’m sure the helping of five poor souls is a fine work, and you may\\nwell be proud of it, Ida. Now I know why you wouldn’t go to matinees\\nwith me, and buy every pretty thing we saw as you used to. The\\npocket money went for coal and food, and your fancy work was little\\nclothes for these live dolls of yours. You dear thing! how good you\\nwere to cook, and grub, and prick your fingers rough, and give up\\nfun, for this kind work!”\\n\\nMaggie’s hearty kiss, and the faces of her friends, made Ida feel\\nthat her humble task had its worth in their eyes, as well as in her\\nown; and when the others had expressed their interest in her work,\\nall composed themselves to hear what Marion had to tell.\\n\\n“I have been taking care of a scarlet runner,--a poor old\\nfrost-bitten, neglected thing; it is transplanted now, and doing\\nwell, I’m happy to say.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Ella, while the rest looked very curious.\\n\\nMarion picked up a dropped stitch in the large blue sock she was\\nknitting, and continued, with a laugh in her eyes: “My dears, that\\nis what we call the Soldiers’ Messenger Corps, with their red caps\\nand busy legs trotting all day. I’ve had one of them to care for,\\nand a gorgeous time of it, I do assure you. But before I exult over\\nmy success, I must honestly confess my failures, for they were sad\\nones. I was so anxious to begin my work at once, that I did go out\\nand collar the first pauper I saw. It was an old man, who sometimes\\nstands at the corners of streets to sell bunches of ugly paper\\nflowers. You’ve seen him, I dare say, and his magenta daisies and\\nyellow peonies. Well, he was rather a forlorn object, with his poor\\nold red nose, and bleary eyes, and white hair, standing at the windy\\ncorners silently holding out those horrid flowers. I bought all he\\nhad that day, and gave them to some colored children on my way home,\\nand told him to come to our house and get an old coat Mamma was\\nwaiting to get rid of. He told a pitiful story of himself and his\\nold wife, who made the paper horrors in her bed, and how they needed\\neverything, but didn’t wish to beg. I was much touched, and flew\\nhome to look up the coat and some shoes, and when my old Lear came\\ncreeping in the back way, I ordered cook to give him a warm dinner\\nand something nice for the old woman.\\n\\n“I was called upstairs while he was mumbling his food, and blessing\\nme in the most lovely manner; and he went away much comforted, I\\nflattered myself. But an hour later, up came the cook in a great\\npanic to report that my venerable and pious beggar had carried off\\nseveral of Papa’s shirts and pairs of socks out of the clothes-basket\\nin the laundry, and the nice warm hood we keep for the girl to hang\\nout clothes in.\\n\\n“I was VERY angry, and, taking Harry with me, went at once to the\\naddress the old rascal gave me, a dirty court out of Hanover Street\\nNo such person had ever lived there, and my white-haired saint was a\\nhumbug. Harry laughed at me, and Mamma forbade me to bring any more\\nthieves to the house, and the girls scolded awfully.\\n\\n“Well, I recovered from the shock, and, nothing daunted, went off to\\nthe little Irishwoman who sells apples on the Common,--not the fat,\\ntosey one with the stall near West Street, but the dried-up one who\\nsits by the path, nodding over an old basket with six apples and\\nfour sticks of candy in it. No one ever seems to buy anything, but\\nshe sits there and trusts to kind souls dropping a dime now and\\nthen; she looks so feeble and forlorn, ‘on the cold, cold ground.’\\n\\n“She told me another sad tale of being all alone and unable to work,\\nand ‘as wake as wather-grewl, without a hap-worth av flesh upon me\\nbones, and for the love of Heaven gimme a thrifle to kape the breath\\nav loife in a poor soul, with a bitter hard winter over me, and\\nniver a chick or child to do a hand’s turn.’ I hadn’t much faith in\\nher, remembering my other humbug, but I did pity the old mummy; so I\\ngot some tea and sugar, and a shawl, and used to give her my odd\\npennies as I passed. I never told at home, they made such fun of my\\nefforts to be charitable. I thought I really was getting on pretty\\nwell after a time, as my old Biddy seemed quite cheered up, and I\\nwas planning to give her some coal, when she disappeared all of a\\nsudden. I feared she was ill, and asked Mrs. Maloney, the fat woman,\\nabout her.\\n\\n“‘Lord love ye, Miss dear, it’s tuk up and sint to the Island for\\ntree months she is; for a drunken ould crayther is Biddy Ryan, and\\nniver a cint but goes for whiskey,--more shame to her, wid a fine\\nbye av her own ready to kape her daycint.’\\n\\n“Then I WAS discouraged, and went home to fold my hands, and see\\nwhat fate would send me, my own efforts being such failures.”\\n\\n“Poor thing, it WAS hard luck!” said Elizabeth, as they sobered down\\nafter the gale of merriment caused by Marion’s mishaps, and her\\nclever imitation of the brogue.\\n\\n“Now tell of your success, and the scarlet runner,” added Maggie.\\n\\n“Ah! that was SENT, and so I prospered. I must begin ever so far\\nback, in war times, or I can’t introduce my hero properly. You know\\nPapa was in the army, and fought all through the war till\\nGettysburg, where he was wounded. He was engaged just before he\\nwent; so when his father hurried to him after that awful battle,\\nMamma went also, and helped nurse him till he could come home. He\\nwouldn’t go to an officer’s hospital, but kept with his men in a\\npoor sort of place, for many of his boys were hit, and he wouldn’t\\nleave them. Sergeant Joe Collins was one of the bravest, and lost\\nhis right arm saving the flag in one of the hottest struggles of\\nthat great fight. He had been a Maine lumberman, and was over six\\nfeet tall, but as gentle as a child, and as jolly as a boy, and very\\nfond of his colonel.\\n\\n“Papa left first, but made Joe promise to let him know how he got\\non, and Joe did so till he too went home. Then Papa lost sight of\\nhim, and in the excitement of his own illness, and the end of the\\nwar, and being married, Joe Collins was forgotten, till we children\\ncame along, and used to love to hear the story of Papa’s battles,\\nand how the brave sergeant caught the flag when the bearer was shot,\\nand held it in the rush till one arm was blown off and the other\\nwounded. We have fighting blood in us, you know, so we were never\\ntired of that story, though twenty-five years or more make it all\\nas far away to us as the old Revolution, where OUR ancestor was\\nkilled, at OUR Bunker Hill!\\n\\n“Last December, just after my sad disappointments, Papa came home to\\ndinner one day, exclaiming, in great glee: ‘I’ve found old Joe! A\\nmessenger came with a letter to me, and when I looked up to give my\\nanswer, there stood a tall, grizzled fellow, as straight as a\\nramrod, grinning from ear to ear, with his hand to his temple,\\nsaluting me in regular style. “Don’t you remember Joe Collins,\\nColonel? Awful glad to see you, sir,” said he. And then it all came\\nback, and we had a good talk, and I found out that the poor old boy\\nwas down on his luck, and almost friendless, but as proud and\\nindependent as ever, and bound to take care of himself while he had\\na leg to stand on. I’ve got his address, and mean to keep an eye on\\nhim, for he looks feeble and can’t make much, I’m sure.’\\n\\n“We were all very glad, and Joe came to see us, and Papa sent him on\\nendless errands, and helped him in that way till he went to New\\nYork. Then, in the fun and flurry of the holidays, we forgot all\\nabout Joe, till Papa came home and missed him from his post. I said\\nI’d go and find him; so Harry and I rummaged about till we did find\\nhim, in a little house at the North End, laid up with rheumatic\\nfever in a stuffy back room, with no one to look after him but the\\nwasherwoman with whom he boarded.\\n\\n“I was SO sorry we had forgotten him! but HE never complained, only\\nsaid, with his cheerful grin,’ I kinder mistrusted the Colonel was\\naway, but I wasn’t goin’ to pester him.’ He tried to be jolly,\\nthough in dreadful pain; called Harry ‘Major,’ and was so grateful\\nfor all we brought him, though he didn’t want oranges and tea, and\\nmade us shout when I said, like a goose, thinking that was the\\nproper thing to do, ‘Shall I bathe your brow, you are so feverish?’\\n\\n“‘No, thanky, miss, it was swabbed pretty stiddy to the horsepittle,\\nand I reckon a trifle of tobaccer would do more good and be a sight\\nmore relishin’, ef you’ll excuse my mentionin’ it.’\\n\\n“Harry rushed off and got a great lump and a pipe, and Joe lay\\nblissfully puffing, in a cloud of smoke, when we left him, promising\\nto come again. We did go nearly every day, and had lovely times; for\\nJoe told us his adventures, and we got so interested in the war that\\nI began to read up evenings, and Papa was pleased, and fought all\\nhis battles over again for us, and Harry and I were great friends\\nreading together, and Papa was charmed to see the old General’s\\nspirit in us, as we got excited and discussed all our wars in a\\nfever of patriotism that made Mamma laugh. Joe said I ‘brustled up’\\nat the word BATTLE like a war-horse at the smell of powder, and I’d\\nought to have been a drummer, the sound of martial music made me so\\n‘skittish.’\\n\\n“It was all new and charming to us young ones, but poor old Joe had\\na hard time, and was very ill. Exposure and fatigue, and scanty\\nfood, and loneliness, and his wounds, were too much for him, and it\\nwas plain his working days were over. He hated the thought of the\\npoor-house at home, which was all his own town could offer him, and\\nhe had no friends to live with, and he could not get a pension,\\nsomething being wrong about his papers; so he would have been badly\\noff, but for the Soldiers’ Home at Chelsea. As soon as he was able,\\nPapa got him in there, and he was glad to go, for that seemed the\\nproper place, and a charity the proudest man might accept, after\\nrisking his life for his country.\\n\\n“There is where I used to be going when you saw me, and I was SO\\nafraid you’d smell the cigars in my basket. The dear old boys always\\nwant them, and Papa says they MUST have them, though it isn’t half\\nso romantic as flowers, and jelly, and wine, and the dainty messes\\nwe women always want to carry. I’ve learned about different kinds of\\ntobacco and cigars, and you’d laugh to see me deal out my gifts,\\nwhich are received as gratefully as the Victoria Cross, when the\\nQueen decorates HER brave men. I’m quite a great gun over there, and\\nthe boys salute when I come, tell me their woes, and think that Papa\\nand I can run the whole concern. I like it immensely, and am as\\nproud and fond of my dear old wrecks as if I’d been a Rigoletto, and\\nridden on a cannon from my babyhood. That’s MY story, but I can’t\\nbegin to tell how interesting it all is, nor how glad I am that it\\nled me to look into the history of American wars, in which brave men\\nof our name did their parts so well.”\\n\\nA hearty round of applause greeted Marion’s tale, for her glowing\\nface and excited voice stirred the patriotic spirit of the Boston\\ngirls, and made them beam approvingly upon her.\\n\\n“Now, Maggie, dear, last but not least, I’m sure,” said Anna, with\\nan encouraging glance, for SHE had discovered the secret of this\\nfriend, and loved her more than ever for it.\\n\\nMaggie blushed and hesitated, as she put down the delicate muslin\\ncap-strings she was hemming with such care. Then, looking about her\\nwith a face in which both humility and pride contended, she said\\nwith an effort, “After the other lively experiences, mine will sound\\nvery flat. In fact, I have no story to tell, for MY charity began at\\nhome, and stopped there.”\\n\\n“Tell it, dear. I know it is interesting, and will do us all good,”\\n said Anna, quickly; and, thus supported, Maggie went on.\\n\\n“I planned great things, and talked about what I meant to do, till\\nPapa said one day, when things were in a mess, as they often are at\\nour house, ‘If the little girls who want to help the world along\\nwould remember that charity begins at home, they would soon find\\nenough to do.’\\n\\n“I was rather taken aback, and said no more, but after Papa had gone\\nto the office, I began to think, and looked round to see what there\\nwas to be done at that particular moment. I found enough for that\\nday, and took hold at once; for poor Mamma had one of her bad\\nheadaches, the children could not go out because it rained, and so\\nwere howling in the nursery, cook was on a rampage, and Maria had\\nthe toothache. Well, I began by making Mamma lie down for a good\\nlong sleep. I kept the children quiet by giving them my ribbon box\\nand jewelry to dress up with, put a poultice on Maria’s face, and\\noffered to wash the glass and silver for her, to appease cook, who\\nwas as cross as two sticks over extra work washing-day. It wasn’t\\nmuch fun, as you may imagine, but I got through the afternoon, and\\nkept the house still, and at dusk crept into Mamma’s room and softly\\nbuilt up the fire, so it should be cheery when she waked. Then I\\nwent trembling to the kitchen for some tea, and there found three\\ngirls calling, and high jinks going on; for one whisked a plate of\\ncake into the table drawer, another put a cup under her shawl, and\\ncook hid the teapot, as I stirred round in the china closet before\\nopening the slide, through a crack of which I’d seen, heard, and\\nsmelt ‘the party,’ as the children call it.\\n\\n“I was angry enough to scold the whole set, but I wisely held my\\ntongue, shut my eyes, and politely asked for some hot water, nodded\\nto the guests, and told cook Maria was better, and would do her work\\nif she wanted to go out.\\n\\n“So peace reigned, and as I settled the tray, I heard cook say in\\nher balmiest tone, for I suspect the cake and tea lay heavy on her\\nconscience, ‘The mistress is very poorly, and Miss takes nice care\\nof her, the dear.’\\n\\n“All blarney, but it pleased me and made me remember how feeble poor\\nMamma was, and how little I really did. So I wept a repentant weep\\nas I toiled upstairs with my tea and toast, and found Mamma all\\nready for them, and so pleased to find things going well. I saw by\\nthat what a relief it would be to her if I did it oftener, as I\\nought, and as I resolved that I would.\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything, but I kept on doing whatever came along, and\\nbefore I knew it ever so many duties slipped out of Mamma’s hands\\ninto mine, and seemed to belong to me. I don’t mean that I liked\\nthem, and didn’t grumble to myself; I did, and felt regularly\\ncrushed and injured sometimes when I wanted to go and have my own\\nfun. Duty is right, but it isn’t easy, and the only comfort about it\\nis a sort of quiet feeling you get after a while, and a strong\\nfeeling, as if you’d found something to hold on to and keep you\\nsteady. I can’t express it, but you know?” And Maggie looked\\nwistfully at the other faces, some of which answered her with a\\nquick flash of sympathy, and some only wore a puzzled yet respectful\\nexpression, as if they felt they ought to know, but did not.\\n\\n“I need not tire you with all my humdrum doings,” continued Maggie.\\n“I made no plans, but just said each day, ‘I’ll take what comes,\\nand try to be cheerful and contented.’ So I looked after the\\nchildren, and that left Maria more time to sew and help round. I did\\nerrands, and went to market, and saw that Papa had his meals\\ncomfortably when Mamma was not able to come down. I made calls for\\nher, and received visitors, and soon went on as if I were the lady\\nof the house, not ‘a chit of a girl,’ as Cousin Tom used to call me.\\n\\n“The best of all were the cosey talks we had in the twilight, Mamma\\nand I, when she was rested, and all the day’s worry was over, and we\\nwere waiting for Papa. Now, when he came, I didn’t have to go away,\\nfor they wanted to ask and tell me things, and consult about\\naffairs, and make me feel that I was really the eldest daughter. Oh,\\nit was just lovely to sit between them and know that they needed me,\\nand loved to have me with them! That made up for the hard and\\ndisagreeable things, and not long ago I got my reward. Mamma is\\nbetter, and I was rejoicing over it, when she said,’ Yes, I really\\nam mending now, and hope soon to be able to relieve my good girl.\\nBut I want to tell you, dear, that when I was most discouraged my\\ngreatest comfort was, that if I had to leave my poor babies they\\nwould find such a faithful little mother in you.’\\n\\n“I was SO pleased I wanted to cry, for the children DO love me, and\\nrun to me for everything now, and think the world of Sister, and\\nthey didn’t use to care much for me. But that wasn’t all. I ought\\nnot to tell these things, perhaps, but I’m so proud of them I can’t\\nhelp it. When I asked Papa privately, if Mamma was REALLY better and\\nin no danger of falling ill again, he said, with his arms round me,\\nand such a tender kiss,--\\n\\n“‘No danger now, for this brave little girl put her shoulder to the\\nwheel so splendidly, that the dear woman got the relief from care\\nshe needed just at the right time, and now she really rests sure\\nthat we are not neglected. You couldn’t have devoted yourself to a\\nbetter charity, or done it more sweetly, my darling. God bless\\nyou!’”\\n\\nHere Maggie’s voice gave out, and she hid her face, with a happy\\nsob, that finished her story eloquently. Marion flew to wipe her\\ntears away with the blue sock, and the others gave a sympathetic\\nmurmur, looking much touched; forgotten duties of their own rose\\nbefore them, and sudden resolutions were made to attend to them at\\nonce, seeing how great Maggie’s reward had been.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be silly; but I wanted you to know that I hadn’t\\nbeen idle all winter, and that, though I haven’t much to tell, I’m\\nquite satisfied with my chore,” she said, looking up with smiles\\nshining through the tears till her face resembled a rose in a\\nsun-shower.\\n\\n“Many daughters have done well, but thou excellest them all,”\\n answered Anna, with a kiss that completed her satisfaction.\\n\\n“Now, as it is after our usual time, and we must break up,”\\n continued the President, producing a basket of flowers from its\\nhiding-place, “I will merely say that I think we have all learned a\\ngood deal, and will be able to work better next winter; for I am\\nsure we shall want to try again, it adds so much sweetness to our\\nown lives to put even a little comfort into the hard lives of the\\npoor. As a farewell token, I sent for some real Plymouth mayflowers,\\nand here they are, a posy apiece, with my love and many thanks for\\nyour help in carrying out my plan so beautifully.”\\n\\nSo the nosegays were bestowed, the last lively chat enjoyed, new\\nplans suggested, and goodbyes said; then the club separated, each\\nmember going gayly away with the rosy flowers on her bosom, and in\\nit a clearer knowledge of the sad side of life, a fresh desire to\\nsee and help still more, and a sweet satisfaction in the thought\\nthat each had done what she could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN IVY SPRAY AND LADIES’ SLIPPERS\\n\\n\\n“IT can’t be done! So I may as well give it I up and get a new pair.\\nI long for them, but I’m afraid my nice little plan for Laura will\\nbe spoilt,” said Jessie Delano to herself, as she shook her head\\nover a pair of small, dilapidated slippers almost past mending.\\nWhile she vainly pricked her fingers over them for the last time,\\nher mind was full of girlish hopes and fears, as well as of\\nanxieties far too serious for a light-hearted creature of sixteen.\\n\\nA year ago the sisters had been the petted daughters of a rich man;\\nbut death and misfortune came suddenly, and now they were left to\\nface poverty alone. They had few relations, and had offended the\\nrich uncle who offered Jessie a home, because she refused to be\\nseparated from her sister. Poor Laura was an invalid, and no one\\nwanted her; but Jessie would not leave her, so they clung together\\nand lived on in the humble rooms where their father died, trying to\\nearn their bread by the only accomplishments they possessed. Laura\\npainted well, and after many disappointments was beginning to find a\\nsale for her dainty designs and delicate flowers. Jessie had a\\nnatural gift for dancing; and her former teacher, a kind-hearted\\nFrenchwoman, offered her favorite pupil the post of assistant\\nteacher in her classes for children.\\n\\nIt cost the girl a struggle to accept a place of this sort and be a\\nhumble teacher, patiently twirling stupid little boys and girls\\nround and round over the smooth floor where she used to dance so\\nhappily when she was the pride of the class and the queen of the\\nclosing balls. But for Laura’s sake she gratefully accepted the\\noffer, glad to add her mite to their small store, and to feel that\\nshe could help keep the wolf from the door. They had seemed to hear\\nthe howl of this dreaded phantom more than once during that year,\\nand looked forward to the long hard winter with an anxiety which\\nneither would confess to the other. Laura feared to fall ill if she\\nworked too hard, and then what would become of this pretty young\\nsister who loved her so tenderly and would not be tempted to leave\\nher? And Jessie could do very little except rebel against their hard\\nfate and make impracticable plans. But each worked bravely, talked\\ncheerfully, and waited hopefully for some good fortune to befall\\nthem, while doubt and pain and poverty and care made the young\\nhearts so heavy that the poor girls often fell asleep on pillows wet\\nwith secret tears.\\n\\nThe smaller trials of life beset Jessie at this particular moment,\\nand her bright wits were trying to solve the problem how to spend\\nher treasured five dollars on slippers for herself and paints for\\nLaura. Both were much needed, and she had gone in shabby shoes to\\nsave up money for the little surprise on which she had set her\\nheart; but now dismay fell upon her when the holes refused to be\\ncobbled, and the largest of bows would not hide the worn-out toes in\\nspite of ink and blacking lavishly applied.\\n\\n“These are the last of my dear French slippers, and I can’t afford\\nany more. I hate cheap things! But I shall have to get them; for my\\nboots are shabby, and every one has to look at my feet when I lead.\\nOh dear, what a horrid thing it is to be poor!” and Jessie surveyed\\nthe shabby little shoes affectionately, as her eyes filled with\\ntears; for the road looked very rough and steep now, when she\\nremembered how she used to dance through life as happy as a\\nbutterfly in a garden full of sunshine and flowers.\\n\\n“Now, Jess, no nonsense, no red eyes to tell tales! Go and do your\\nerrands, and come in as gay as a lark, or Laura will be worried.”\\n And springing up, the girl began to sing instead of sob, as she\\nstirred about her dismal little room, cleaning her old gloves,\\nmending her one white dress, and wishing with a sigh of intense\\nlonging that she could afford some flowers to wear, every ornament\\nhaving been sold long ago. Then, with a kiss and a smile to her\\npatient sister, she hurried away to get the necessary slippers and\\nthe much-desired paints, which Laura would not ask for, though her\\nwork waited for want of them.\\n\\nHaving been reared in luxury, poor little Jessie’s tastes were all\\nof the daintiest sort; and her hardest trial, after Laura’s feeble\\nhealth, was the daily sacrifice of the many comforts and elegances\\nto which she had been accustomed. Faded gowns, cleaned gloves, and\\nmended boots cost her many a pang, and the constant temptation of\\nseeing pretty, useful, and unattainable things was a very hard one.\\nLaura rarely went out, and so was spared this cross; then she was\\nthree years older, had always been delicate, and lived much in a\\nhappy world of her own. So Jessie bore her trials silently, but\\nsometimes felt very covetous and resentful to see so much pleasure,\\nmoney, and beauty in the world, and yet have so little of it fall to\\nher lot.\\n\\n“I feel as if I could pick a pocket to-day and not mind a bit, if it\\nwere a rich person’s. It’s a shame, when papa was always so\\ngenerous, that no one remembers us. If ever I’m rich again, I’ll\\njust hunt up all the poor girls I can find, and give them nice\\nshoes, if nothing else,” she thought, as she went along the crowded\\nstreets, pausing involuntarily at the shop windows to look with\\nlonging eyes at the treasures within.\\n\\nResisting the allurements of French slippers with bows and buckles,\\nshe wisely bought a plain, serviceable pair, and trudged away,\\nfinding balm for her wounds in the fact that they were very cheap.\\nMore balm came when she met a young friend, who joined her as she\\nstood wistfully eying the piles of grapes in a window and longing to\\nbuy some for Laura.\\n\\nThis warm-hearted schoolmate read the wish before Jessie saw her,\\nand gratified it so adroitly that the girl could accept the pretty\\nbasketful sent to her sister without feeling like a spendthrift or a\\nbeggar. It comforted her very much, and the world began to look\\nbrighter after that little touch of kindness, as it always does when\\ngenuine sympathy makes sunshine in shady places.\\n\\nAt the art store she was told that more of Laura’s autumn-flowers\\nwere in demand; and her face was so full of innocent delight and\\ngratitude it quite touched the old man who sold her the paints, and\\ngave her more than her money’s worth, remembering his own hard times\\nand pitying the pretty young girl whose father he had known.\\n\\nSo Jessie did not have to pretend very hard at being “as gay as a\\nlark” when she got home and showed her treasures. Laura was so happy\\nover the unexpected gifts that the dinner of bread and milk and\\ngrapes was quite a picnic; and Jessie found a smile on her face when\\nshe went to dress for her party.\\n\\nIt was only a child’s party at the house of one of Mademoiselle’s\\npupils, and Jessie was merely invited to help the little people\\nthrough their dancing. She did not like to go in this way, as she\\nwas sure to meet familiar faces there, full of the pity, curiosity,\\nor indifference so hard for a girl to bear. But Mademoiselle asked\\nit as a favor, and Jessie was grateful; so she went, expecting no\\npleasure and certain of much weariness, if not annoyance.\\n\\nWhen she was ready,--and it did not take long to slip on the white\\nwoollen dress, brush out the curly dark hair, and fold up slippers\\nand gloves,--she stood before her glass looking at herself, quite\\nconscious that she was very pretty, with her large eyes, blooming\\ncheeks, and the lofty little air which nothing could change. She was\\nalso painfully conscious that her dress was neither fresh nor\\nbecoming without a bit of ribbon or a knot of flowers to give it the\\ntouch of color it needed. She had an artistic eye, and used to\\ndelight in ordering charming costumes for herself in the happy days\\nwhen all her wishes were granted as if fairies still lived. She\\ntossed over her very small store of ribbons in vain; everything had\\nbeen worn till neither beauty nor freshness remained.\\n\\n“Oh dear! where CAN I find something to make me look less like a\\nnun,--and a very shabby one, too?” she said, longing for the pink\\ncorals she sold to pay Laura’s doctor’s bill.\\n\\nThe sound of a soft tap, tap, tap, startled her, and she ran to open\\nthe door. No one was there but Laura, fast asleep on the sofa. Tap,\\ntap, tap! went the invisible hand; and as the sound seemed to come\\nfrom the window, Jessie glanced that way, thinking her tame dove had\\ncome to be fed. Neither hungry dove nor bold sparrow appeared,--only\\na spray of Japanese ivy waving in the wind. A very pretty spray it\\nwas, covered with tiny crimson leaves; and it tapped impatiently, as\\nif it answered her question by saying, “Here is a garland for you;\\ncome and take it.”\\n\\nJessie’s quick eye was caught at once by the fine color, and running\\nto the window she looked out as eagerly as if a new idea had come\\ninto her head. It was a dull November day, and the prospect of\\nsheds, ash-barrels, and old brooms was a gloomy one; but the whole\\nback of the house glowed with the red tendrils of the hardy vine\\nthat clung to and covered the dingy bricks with a royal mantle, as\\nif eager to cheer the eyes and hearts of all who looked. It preached\\na little sermon of courage, aspiration, and content to those who had\\nthe skill to read it, and bade them see how, springing from the\\nscanty soil of that back yard full of the commonest objects, the\\nhumblest work, it set its little creepers in the crannies of the\\nstone, and struggled up to find the sun and air, till it grew strong\\nand beautiful,--making the blank wall green in summer, glorious in\\nautumn, and a refuge in winter, when it welcomed the sparrows to the\\nshelter of its branches where the sun lay warmest.\\n\\nJessie loved this beautiful neighbor, and had enjoyed it all that\\nsummer,--the first she ever spent in the hot city. She felt the\\ngrace its greenness gave to all it touched, and half unconsciously\\nimitated it in trying to be brave and bright, as she also climbed up\\nfrom the dismal place where she seemed shut away from everything\\nlovely, till she was beginning to discover that the blue sky was\\nover all, the sun still shone for her, and heaven’s fresh air kissed\\nher cheeks as kindly as ever. Many a night she had leaned from the\\nhigh window when Laura was asleep, dreaming innocent dreams, living\\nover her short past, or trying to look into the future bravely and\\ntrustfully. The little vine had felt warmer drops than rain or dew\\nfall on it when things went badly, had heard whispered prayers when\\nthe lonely child asked the Father of the fatherless for help and\\ncomfort, had peeped in to see her sleeping peacefully when the hard\\nhour was over, and been the first to greet her with a tap on the\\nwindow-pane as she woke full of new hope in the morning. It seemed\\nto know all her moods and troubles, to be her friend and confidante,\\nand now came with help like a fairy godmother when our Cinderella\\nwanted to be fine for the little ball.\\n\\n“Just the thing! Why didn’t I think of it? So bright and delicate\\nand becoming? It will last better than flowers; and no one can think\\nI’m extravagant, since it costs nothing.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Jessie was gathering long sprays of the rosy vine,\\nwith its glossy leaves so beautifully shaded that it was evident\\nJack Frost had done his best for it. Going to her glass, she\\nfastened a wreath of the smallest leaves about her head, set a\\ncluster of larger ones in her bosom, and then surveyed herself with\\ngirlish pleasure, as well she might; for the effect of the simple\\ndecoration was charming. Quite satisfied now, she tied on her cloud\\nand slipped away without waking Laura, little dreaming what good\\nfortune the ivy spray was to bring them both.\\n\\nShe found the children prancing with impatience to begin their\\nballet, much excited by the music, gaslight, and gay dresses, which\\nmade it seem like “a truly ball.” All welcomed Jessie, and she soon\\nforgot the cheap slippers, mended gloves, and old dress, as she\\ngayly led her troop through the pretty dance with so much grace and\\nskill that the admiring mammas who lined the walls declared it was\\nthe sweetest thing they ever saw.\\n\\n“Who is that little person?” asked one of the few gentlemen who\\nhovered about the doorways.\\n\\nHis hostess told Jessie’s story in a few words, and was surprised to\\nhear him say in a satisfied tone,--\\n\\n“I’m glad she is poor. I want her head, and now there is some chance\\nof getting it.”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Vane, what DO you mean?” asked the lady, laughing.\\n\\n“I came to study young faces; I want one for a picture, and that\\nlittle girl with the red leaves is charming. Please present me.”\\n\\n“No use; you may ask for her hand by-and-by, if you like, but not\\nfor her head. She is very proud, and never would consent to sit as a\\nmodel, I’m sure.”\\n\\n“I think I can manage it, if you will kindly give me a start.”\\n\\n“Very well. The children are just going down to supper, and Miss\\nDelano will rest. You can make your bold proposal now, if you dare.”\\n\\nA moment later, as she stood watching the little ones troop away,\\nJessie found herself bowing to the tall gentleman, who begged to\\nknow what he could bring her with as much interest as if she had\\nbeen the finest lady in the room. Of course she chose ice-cream, and\\nslipped into a corner to rest her tired feet, preferring the\\ndeserted parlor to the noisy dining-room,--not being quite sure\\nwhere she belonged now.\\n\\nMr. Vane brought her a salver full of the dainties girls best love,\\nand drawing up a table began to eat and talk in such a simple,\\ncomfortable way that Jessie could not feel shy, but was soon quite\\nat her ease. She knew that he was a famous artist, and longed to\\ntell him about poor Laura, who admired his pictures so much and\\nwould have enjoyed every moment of this chance interview. He was not\\na very young man, nor a handsome one, but he had a genial face, and\\nthe friendly manners which are so charming; and in ten minutes\\nJessie was chatting freely, quite unconscious that the artist was\\nstudying her in a mirror all the while. They naturally talked of the\\nchildren, and after praising the pretty dance Mr. Vane quietly\\nadded,--\\n\\n“I’ve been trying--to find a face among them for a picture I’m\\ndoing; but the little dears are all too young, and I must look\\nelsewhere for a model for my wood-nymph.”\\n\\n“Are models hard to find?” asked Jessie, eating her ice with the\\nrelish of a girl who does not often taste it.\\n\\n“What I want is very hard to find. I can get plenty of beggar-girls,\\nbut this must be a refined face, young and blooming, but with poetry\\nin it; and that does not come without a different training from any\\nmy usual models get. It will be difficult to suit me, for I’m in a\\nhurry and don’t know where to look,”--which last sentence was not\\nquite true, for the long glass showed him exactly what he wanted.\\n\\n“I help Mademoiselle with her classes, and she has pupils of all\\nages; perhaps you could find some one there.”\\n\\nJessie looked so interested that the artist felt that he had begun\\nwell, and ventured a step further as he passed the cake-basket for\\nthe third time.\\n\\n“You are very kind; but the trouble there is, that I fear none of\\nthe young ladies would consent to sit to me if I dared to ask them.\\nI will confide to you that I HAVE seen a head which quite suits me;\\nbut I fear I cannot get it. Give me your advice, please. Should you\\nthink this pretty creature would be offended, if I made the request\\nmost respectfully?”\\n\\n“No, indeed; I should think she would be proud to help with one of\\nyour pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; and we\\nkept one of them when we had to sell all the rest,” said Jessie, in\\nher eager, frank way.\\n\\n“That was a beautiful compliment, and I am proud of it. Please tell\\nher so, with my thanks. Which was it?”\\n\\n“The woman’s head,--the sad, sweet one people call a Madonna. We\\ncall it Mother, and love it very much, for Laura says it is like our\\nmother. I never saw her, but my sister remembers the dear face very\\nwell.”\\n\\nJessie’s eyes dropped, as if tears were near; and Mr. Vane said, in\\na voice which showed he understood and shared her feeling,--\\n\\n“I am very glad that anything of mine has been a comfort to you. I\\nthought of my own mother when I painted that picture years ago; so\\nyou see you read it truly, and gave it the right name. Now, about\\nthe other head; you think I may venture to propose the idea to its\\nowner, do you?”\\n\\n“Why not, sir? She would be very silly to refuse, I think.”\\n\\n“Then YOU wouldn’t be offended if asked to sit in this way?”\\n\\n“Oh, no. I’ve sat for Laura many a time, and she says I make a very\\ngood model. But then, she only paints simple little things that I am\\nfit for.”\\n\\n“That is just what I want to do. Would you mind asking the young\\nlady for me? She is just behind you.”\\n\\nJessie turned with a start, wondering who had come in; but all she\\nsaw was her own curious face in the mirror, and Mr. Vane’s smiling\\none above it.\\n\\n“Do you mean me?” she cried, so surprised and pleased and half\\nashamed that she could only blush and laugh and look prettier than\\never.\\n\\n“Indeed I do. Mrs. Murray thought the request would annoy you; but I\\nfancied you would grant it, you wore such a graceful little garland,\\nand seemed so interested in the pictures here.”\\n\\n“It is only a bit of ivy, but so pretty I wanted to wear it, as I\\nhad nothing else,” said the girl, glad that her simple ornament\\nfound favor in such eyes.\\n\\n“It is most artistic, and caught my eye at once. I said to myself,’\\nThat is the head I want, and I MUST secure it if possible.’ Can I?”\\n asked Mr. Vane, smiling persuasively as he saw what a frank and\\nartless young person he had to deal with.\\n\\n“With pleasure, if Laura doesn’t mind. I’ll ask her, and if she is\\nwilling I shall be very proud to have even my wreath in a famous\\npicture,” answered Jessie, so full of innocent delight at being thus\\nhonored that it was a pretty sight to see.\\n\\n“A thousand thanks! Now I can exult over Mrs. Murray, and get my\\npalette ready. When can we begin? As your sister is an invalid and\\ncannot come to my studio with you, perhaps you will allow me to make\\nmy sketch at your own house,” said Mr. Vane, as pleased with his\\nsuccess as only a perplexed artist could be.\\n\\n“Did Mrs. Murray tell you about us?” asked Jessie quickly, as her\\nsmiles faded away and the proud look came into her face; for she was\\nsure their misfortunes were known, since he spoke of poor Laura’s\\nhealth.\\n\\n“A little,” began the new friend, with a sympathetic glance.\\n\\n“I know models are paid for sitting; did you wish to do it with me\\nbecause I’m poor?” asked Jessie, with an irrepressible frown and a\\nglance at the thrice-cleaned dress and the neatly mended gloves.\\n\\nMr. Vane knew what thorn pricked the sensitive little girl, and\\nanswered in his friendliest tone,--\\n\\n“I never thought of such a thing. I wanted YOU to help ME, because I\\nam poor in what artists so much need,--real grace and beauty. I\\nhoped you would allow me to give your sister a copy of the sketch as\\na token of my gratitude for your great kindness.”\\n\\nThe frown vanished and the smile returned as the soft answer turned\\naway Jessie’s wrath and made her hasten to say penitently,--\\n\\n“I was very rude; but I haven’t learned to be humble yet, and often\\nforget that I am poor. Please come to us any time. Laura will enjoy\\nseeing you work, and be delighted with anything you give her. So\\nshall I, though I don’t deserve it.”\\n\\n“I won’t punish you by painting the frown that quite frightened me\\njust now, but do my best to keep the happy face, and so heap coals\\nof fire on your head. They won’t burn any more than the pretty red\\nleaves that brought me this good fortune,” answered the artist,\\nseeing that his peace was made.\\n\\n“I’m SO glad I wore them!” and as if trying to make amends for her\\nlittle flash of temper, Jessie told him about the ivy, and how she\\nloved it,--unconsciously betraying more of her pathetic little story\\nthan she knew, and increasing her hearer’s interest in his new\\nmodel.\\n\\nThe children came back in riotous spirits, and Jessie was called to\\nlead the revels again. But now her heart was as light as her heels;\\nfor she had something pleasant to think of,--a hope of help for\\nLaura, and the memory of kind words to make hard duties easier. Mr.\\nVane soon slipped away, promising to come the next day; and at eight\\no’clock Jessie ran home to tell her sister the good news, and to\\npress the little wreath which had served her so well.\\n\\nWith the sanguine spirit of girlhood, she felt sure that something\\ndelightful would happen, and built fine castles in the air for her\\nsister, with a small corner for herself, where she could watch Laura\\nbloom into a healthy woman and a great artist. The desire of\\nJessie’s heart was to earn eneugh money to enable them to spend a\\nmonth or two at the seashore when summer came, as that was the\\nsurest cure for Laura’s weak nerves and muscles. She had cherished\\nthe wild idea of being a ballet-girl, as dancing was her delight;\\nbut every one frowned upon that plan, and her own refined nature\\ntold her that it was not the life for a young girl. Mr. Vane’s\\nrequest for her head suggested a splendid hope; and after getting\\nangry with him for hinting at her being a model, she suddenly\\ndecided to try it,--with the charming inconsistency of her sex. The\\nmore she thought of it, the better she liked the idea, and resolved\\nto ask her new friend all about it, fondly hoping that much money\\ncould be made in this way.\\n\\nShe said nothing to her sister, but while she sat patiently to Mr.\\nVane when he came next day, she asked many questions; and though\\nsomewhat discouraged by his replies, confided to him her hopes and\\nbegged his advice. Being a wise man as well as a good and kindly\\none, he saw at once that this life would not be safe for the pretty,\\nimpulsive, and tenderly reared girl, left so unprotected in a world\\nfull of trials and temptations. So he told her it would not do,\\nexcept so far as she would allow him to make several studies of her\\nhead in various characters and pay for them.\\n\\nShe consented, and though much disappointed found some consolation\\nin hoarding a part of the handsome sum so earned for the desire of\\nher heart.\\n\\nThe artist seemed in no haste to finish his work, and for some weeks\\ncame often to the sittings in that quiet room; for it grew more and\\nmore attractive to him, and while he painted the younger sister’s\\nchangeful face he studied the beautiful nature of the elder and\\nlearned to love it. But no one guessed that secret for a long time;\\nand Jessie was so busy racking her brain for a way to earn more\\nmoney that she was as blind and deaf to much that went on before her\\nas if she had been a wooden dummy.\\n\\nSuddenly, when she least expected it, help came, and in such a\\ndelightful way that she long remembered the little episode with\\ngirlish satisfaction. One day as she sat wearily waiting till the\\ndressing-room was cleared of maids and children after the\\ndancing-class was over, a former friend came sauntering up to her,\\nsaying In the tone which always nettled Jessie,--\\n\\n“You poor thing! aren’t you tired to death trying to teach these\\nstupid babies?”\\n\\n“No; I love to dance, and we had new figures to-day. See! isn’t this\\npretty?” and Jessie, who knew her own skill and loved to display it,\\ntwirled away as lightly as if her feet were not aching with two\\nhours of hard work.\\n\\n“Lovely! I do wish I ever could learn to keep time and not jerk and\\nbounce. Being plump is a dreadful trial,” sighed Fanny Fletcher, as\\nJessie came back beaming and breathless.\\n\\n“Perhaps I can teach you. I think of making this my profession since\\nI must do something. Mademoiselle earns heaps of money by it,” she\\nsaid, sitting down to rest, resolved not to be ashamed of her work\\nor to let Fanny pity her.\\n\\n“I wish you COULD teach me, for I know I shall disgrace myself at\\nthe Kirmess. You’ve heard about it, of course? So sorry you can’t\\ntake a part, for it’s going to be great fun and very splendid. I am\\nin the Hungarian dance, and it’s one of the hardest; but the dress\\nis lovely, and I would be in it. Mamma is the matron of it; so I had\\nmy way, though I know the girls don’t want me, and the boys make fun\\nof me. Just see if this isn’t the queerest step you ever beheld!”\\n\\nFanny started bravely across the wide smooth floor, with a stamp, a\\nslide, and a twirl which was certainly odd, but might have been\\nlively and graceful if she had not unfortunately been a very plump,\\nawkward girl, with no more elasticity than a feather-bed. Jessie\\nfound it impossible not to laugh when Fanny ended her display with a\\nsprawl upon the floor, and sat rubbing her elbows in an attitude of\\ndespair.\\n\\n“I know that dance! It is the tzardas, and I can show you how it\\nshould be done. Jump up and try it with me!” she said good-naturedly,\\nrunning to help her friend up, glad to have a partner of her own\\nsize for once.\\n\\nAway they went, but soon stopped; for Fanny could not keep step, and\\nJessie pulled and stamped and hummed in vain.\\n\\n“Do it alone; then I can see how it goes, and manage better next\\ntime,” panted the poor girl, dropping down upon the velvet seat\\nwhich ran round the hall.\\n\\nMademoiselle had come in and watched them for a moment. She saw at\\nonce what was needed, and as Mrs. Fletcher was one of her best\\npatrons, she was glad to oblige the oldest daughter; so she went to\\nthe piano and struck up the proper air just as Jessie, with one arm\\non her hip, the other on the shoulder of an invisible partner, went\\ndown the hall with a martial stamp, a quick slide, and a graceful\\nturn, in perfect time to the stirring music that made her nerves\\ntingle and her feet fly. To and fro, round and round, with all\\nmanner of graceful gestures, intricate steps, and active bounds went\\nthe happy girl, quite carried away by the music and motion of the\\npastime she loved so much.\\n\\nFanny clapped her hands with admiration, and Mademoiselle cried,\\n“Bien, tres bien, charmante, ma cherie!” as she paused at last, rosy\\nand smiling, with one hand on her heart and the other at her temple\\nwith the salute that closed the dance.\\n\\n“I MUST learn it! Do come and give me lessons at our house. I called\\nfor Maud and must go now. Will you come, Jessie? I’ll be glad to pay\\nyou if you don’t mind. I hate to be laughed at; and I know if some\\none would just help me alone I should do as well as the rest, for\\nProfessor Ludwig raves at us all.”\\n\\nFanny seemed in such a sad strait, and Jessie sympathized so\\nheartily with her, that she could not refuse a request which\\nflattered her vanity and tempted her with a prospect of some\\naddition to the “Sister-fund,” as she called her little savings. So\\nshe graciously consented, and after a few laborious lessons\\nprospered so well that her grateful pupil proposed to several other\\nunsuccessful dancers in the set to invite Jessie to the private\\nrehearsals held in various parlors as the festival drew near.\\n\\nSome of these young people knew Jessie Delano, had missed the bright\\ngirl, and gladly welcomed her back when, after much persuasion, she\\nagreed to go and help them with the difficult figures of the\\ntzardas. Once among them she felt in her element, and trained the\\nawkward squad so well that Professor Ludwig complimented them on\\ntheir improvement at the public rehearsals, and raved no more, to\\nthe great delight of the timid damsels, who lost their wits when the\\nfiery little man shouted and wrung his hands over their mistakes.\\n\\nThe young gentlemen needed help also, as several of them looked very\\nmuch like galvanized grasshoppers in their efforts to manage long\\nlegs or awkward elbows. Jessie willingly danced with them, and\\nshowed them how to move with grace and spirit, and handle their\\npartners less like dolls and more like peasant maidens with whom the\\nmartial Hungarians were supposed to be disporting themselves at the\\nfair. Merry meetings were these; and all enjoyed them, as young\\npeople do whatever is lively, dramatic, and social. Every one was\\nfull of the brilliant Kirmess, which was the talk of the city, and\\nto which every one intended to go as actor or spectator. Jessie was\\nsadly tempted to spend three of her cherished dollars for a ticket,\\nand perhaps would have done so if there had been any one to take\\ncare of her. Laura could not go, and Mr. Vane was away; no other\\nfriend appeared, and no one remembered to invite her, so she bravely\\nhid her girlish longing, and got all the pleasure out of the\\nrehearsals that she could.\\n\\nAt the last of these, which was a full-dress affair at Fanny’s\\nhouse, something happened which not only tried Jessie’s temper\\nsorely, but brought her a reward for many small sacrifices. So much\\ndancing was very hard upon her slippers, the new pair were worn out\\nlong ago, and a second pair were in a dangerous condition; but\\nJessie hoped that they would last that evening, and then she would\\nindulge in better ones with what Fanny would pay her. She hated to\\ntake it, but her salary at Mademoiselle’s was needed at home; all\\nshe could spare from other sources was sacredly kept for Laura’s\\njaunt, and only now and then did the good little girl buy some very\\nnecessary article for herself. She was learning to be humble, to\\nlove work, and be grateful for her small wages for her sister’s\\nsake; and while she hid her trials, withstood her temptations, and\\nbravely tugged away at her hard tasks, the kind Providence, who\\nteaches us the sweetness of adversity, was preparing a more\\nbeautiful and helpful surprise than any she could plan or execute.\\n\\nThat night all were much excited, and great was the energy displayed\\nas the scarlet, blue, and silver couples went through the rapid\\nfigures with unusual spirit and success. The brass-heeled boots\\nstamped in perfect time, the furred caps waved, and the braided\\njackets glittered as the gay troop swung to and fro or marched to\\nthe barbaric music of an impromptu band. Jessie looked on with such\\nlonging in her eyes that Fanny, who was ill with a bad cold, kindly\\nbegged her to take her place, as motion made her cough, and putting\\non the red and silver cap sent her joyfully away to lead them all.\\n\\nThe fun grew rather fast and furious toward the end, and when the\\ndance broke up there lay in the middle of the floor a shabby little\\nslipper, burst at the side, trodden down at the heel, and utterly\\ndemoralized as to the bow with a broken buckle in it. Such a\\ndisreputable little shoe was it that no one claimed it when one of\\nthe young men held it up on the point of his sword, exclaiming\\ngayly,--\\n\\n“Where is Cinderella? Here’s her shoe, and it’s quite time she had a\\nnew pair. Glass evidently doesn’t wear well now-a-days.”\\n\\nThey all laughed and looked about to find the shoeless foot. The\\ngirls with small feet displayed them readily; those less blessed hid\\nthem at once, and no Cinderella appeared to claim the old slipper.\\nJessie turned as red as her cap, and glanced imploringly at Fanny as\\nshe slipped through a convenient door and flew up-stairs, knowing\\nthat in a moment all would see that it must be hers, since the other\\ngirls wore red boots as a part of their costume.\\n\\nFanny understood; and though awkward and slow with her feet, she was\\nkind-hearted and quick to spare her friend the mortification which a\\npoor and proud girl could not help feeling at such a moment. The\\nunfortunate slipper was flying from hand to hand as the youths\\nindulged in a boyish game of ball to tease the laughing girls, who\\nhastened to disclaim all knowledge of “the horrid thing.”\\n\\n“Please give it to me!” cried Fanny, trying to catch it, and glad\\nJessie was safe.\\n\\n“No; Cinderella must come and put it on. Here’s the Prince all ready\\nto help her,” said the finder of the shoe, holding it up.\\n\\n“And here are lots of proud sisters ready to cut off their toes and\\nheels if they could only get on such a small slipper,” added another\\nyoung Mygar, enjoying the fun immensely.\\n\\n“Listen, and let me tell you something. It’s Jessie Delano’s, and\\nshe has run away because she lost it. Don’t laugh and make fun of\\nit, because it was worn out in helping us. You all know what a hard\\ntime she has had, but you don’t know how good and brave and patient\\nshe is, trying to help poor Laura and to earn her living. I asked\\nher to teach me, and I shall pay her well for it, because I couldn’t\\nhave gone on if she hadn’t. If any of you feel as grateful as I do,\\nand as sorry for her, you can show it in any kind way you please,\\nfor it must be dreadful to be so poor.”\\n\\nFanny had spoken quickly, and at the last words hid the tremble in\\nher voice with a cough, being rather scared at what she had done on\\nthe impulse of the moment. But it was a true impulse, and the\\ngenerous young hearts were quick to answer it. The old slipper was\\nrespectfully handed to her with many apologies and various penitent\\nsuggestions. None were adopted just then, however, for Fanny ran off\\nto find Jessie with her things on waiting for a chance to slip away\\nunseen. No persuasions would keep her to supper; and at last, with\\nmany thanks, she was allowed to go, while Fanny returned to lay\\nplans with her guests as they disturbed their digestions with\\nlobster salad, ice-cream, and strong coffee.\\n\\nFeeling more than ever like Cinderella as she hurried out into the\\nwinter night, leaving all the good times behind her, Jessie stood\\nwaiting for a car on the windy street-corner, with the ragged\\nslippers under her arm, tears of weariness and vexation in her eyes,\\nand a resentful feeling against an unjust fate lying heavy at her\\nheart. The glimpses of her old gay, easy life, which these\\nrehearsals had given her, made the real hardship and loneliness of\\nher present life all the more irksome, and that night she felt as if\\nshe could not bear it much longer. She longed with all a girl’s love\\nof gayety to go to the Kirmess, and no one thought to invite her.\\nShe could not go alone even if she yielded to temptation and spent\\nher own money. Laura would have to hire a carriage if she ventured\\nto try it; so it was impossible, for six or seven dollars was a\\nfortune to the poor girls now. To have been one of the happy\\ncreatures who were to take part in it, to dance on the green in a\\ndainty costume to the music of a full band,--to see and do and enjoy\\nall the delights of those two enchanting evenings, would have filled\\nJessie’s cup to overflowing. But since she might as well cry for the\\nmoon she tried to get some comfort out of imagining it all as she\\nrumbled home in a snowstorm, and cried herself to sleep after giving\\nLaura a cheerful account of the rehearsal, omitting the catastrophe.\\n\\nThe sun shone next morning, hope woke again, and as she dressed\\nJessie sung to keep her heart up, still trusting that some one would\\nremember her before the day was over. As she opened her windows the\\nsparrows welcomed her with shrill chirpings, and the sun turned the\\nsnow-covered vine to a glittering network very beautiful to see as\\nit hung like a veil of lace over the dingy wall. Jessie smiled as\\nshe saw it, while taking a long breath of the keen air, feeling\\ncheered and refreshed by these familiar comforters; then with a\\nbrave, bright glance up at the clear blue sky she went away to the\\nday’s duties, little guessing what pleasant surprises were on their\\nway to reward her for the little sacrifices which were teaching her\\nstrength, patience, and courage for greater ones by-and-by.\\n\\nAll the morning she listened eagerly for the bell, but nothing came;\\nand at two o’clock she went away to the dancing-class, saying to\\nherself with a sigh,--\\n\\n“Every one is so busy, it is no wonder I’m forgotten. I shall hear\\nabout the fun in the papers, and try to be contented with that.”\\n\\nThough she never felt less like dancing, she was very patient with\\nher little pupils, and when the lesson was over sat resting a\\nmoment, with her head still full of the glories of the Kirmess.\\nSuddenly Mademoiselle came to her, and in a few kind words gave her\\nthe first of the pleasant surprises by offering her a larger salary,\\nan older class, and many commendations for her skill and\\nfaithfulness. Of course she gratefully accepted the welcome offer,\\nand hurried home to tell Laura, forgetting her heavy heart, tired\\nfeet, and disappointed hopes.\\n\\nAt her own door the second surprise stood waiting for her, in the\\nperson of Mrs. Fletcher’s servant with a large box and a note from\\nMiss Fanny. How she ever got herself and her parcel up the long\\nstairs Jessie never knew, she was in such a frantic hurry to see\\nwhat that vast box could contain. She startled her sister by\\nbursting into the room breathless, flushed, and beaming, with the\\nmysterious cry of,--\\n\\n“Scissors! quick, the scissors!”\\n\\nOff went cords and papers, up flew the cover, and with a shriek of\\nrapture Jessie saw the well-known Hungarian costume lying there\\nbefore her. What it all meant she could not guess, till she tore\\nopen the note and read these delightful words:--\\n\\nDEAR JESS,--My cold is worse, and the doctor won’t let me go\\nto-night. Isn’t it dreadful? Our dance will be ruined unless you\\nwill take my place. I know you will to oblige us, and have a lovely\\ntime. Every one will be glad, you do it so much better than I can.\\nMy dress will fit you, with tucks and reefs here and there; and the\\nboots won’t be much too large, for though I’m fat I have small feet,\\nthank goodness! Mamma will call for you at seven, and bring you\\nsafely home; and you must come early to-morrow and tell me all about\\nit.\\n\\nIn the small box you will find a little token of our gratitude to\\nyou for your kindness in helping us all so much. Yours ever,\\n\\nFAN.\\n\\nAs soon as Jessie could get her breath and recover from this first\\ndelightful shock, she opened the dainty parcel carefully tied up\\nwith pink ribbons. It proved to be a crystal slipper, apparently\\nfull of rosebuds; but under the flowers lay five-and-twenty shining\\ngold dollars. A little card with these words was tucked in one\\ncorner, as if, with all their devices to make the offering as\\ndelicate and pretty as possible, the givers feared to offend:--\\n\\n“We return to our dear Princess the glass slipper which she lost at\\nthe ball, full of thanks and good wishes.”\\n\\nIf the kind young persons who sent the fanciful gift could have seen\\nhow it was received, their doubts would soon have been set at rest;\\nfor Jessie laughed and cried as she told the story, counted the\\nprecious coins, and filled the pretty shoe with water that the buds\\nmight keep fresh for Laura. Then, while the needles flew and the gay\\ngarments were fitted, the happy voices talked and the sisters\\nrejoiced together over this unexpected pleasure as only loving girls\\ncould do.\\n\\n“The sweetest part of all the splendid surprise is that they\\nremembered me just at the busiest time, and thanked me in such a\\nlovely way. I shall keep that glass slipper all my life, if I can,\\nto remind me not to despair; for just when everything seemed\\ndarkest, all this good luck came,” said Jessie, with ecstatic skips\\nas she clanked the brass heels of her boots and thought of the proud\\nmoment when she would join in the tzardas before all Boston.\\n\\nGentle Laura rejoiced and sympathized heartily, sewed like a busy\\nbee, and sent her happy sister away at seven o’clock with her\\nsweetest smile, never letting her suspect what tender hopes and\\nfears were hidden in her own heart, what longing and disappointment\\nmade her days doubly sad and lonely, or how very poor a consolation\\nall the glories of the Kirmess would be for the loss of a friend who\\nhad grown very near and dear to her.\\n\\nNo need to tell the raptures of that evening to little Jessie, who\\nenjoyed every moment, played her part well, and was brought home at\\nmidnight ready to begin all over again, so inexhaustible is youth’s\\nappetite for pleasure.\\n\\nTo her great surprise, Laura was up and waiting to welcome her, with\\na face so full of a new and lovely happiness that Jessie guessed at\\nonce some good fortune had come to her also. Yes, Laura’s\\nwell-earned reward and beautiful surprise had arrived at last; and\\nshe told it all in a few words as she held out her arms\\nexclaiming,--\\n\\n“He has come back! He loves me, and I am so happy! Dear little\\nsister, all your hard times are over now, and you shall have a home\\nagain.”\\n\\nSo the dreams came true, as they sometimes do even in this\\nwork-a-day world of ours, when the dreamers strive as well as hope,\\nand earn their rewards.\\n\\nLaura had a restful summer at the seaside, with a stronger arm than\\nJessie’s to lean upon, and more magical medicine to help her back to\\nhealth than any mortal doctor could prescribe. Jessie danced again\\nwith a light heart,--for pleasure, not for pay,--and found the new\\nlife all the sweeter for the trials of the old one. In the autumn\\nthere was a quiet wedding, before three very happy people sailed\\naway to Italy, the artist’s heaven on earth.\\n\\n“No roses for me,” said Jessie, smiling at herself in the mirror as\\nshe fastened a spray of rosy ivy-leaves in the bosom of her fresh\\nwhite gown that October morning. “I’ll be true to my old friend; for\\nit helped me in my dark days, and now it shall rejoice with me in my\\nbright ones, and go on teaching me to climb bravely and patiently\\ntoward the light.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPANSIES\\n\\n\\nThey are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts.--SIR\\nPHILIP SIDNEY.\\n\\n“I’VE finished my book, and now what CAN I do till this tiresome\\nrain is over?” exclaimed Carrie, as she lay back on the couch with a\\nyawn of weariness.\\n\\n“Take another and a better book; the house is full of them, and this\\nis a rare chance for a feast on the best,” answered Alice, looking\\nover the pile of volumes in her lap, as she sat on the floor before\\none of the tall book-cases that lined the room.\\n\\n“Not being a book-worm like you, I can’t read forever, and you\\nneedn’t sniff at ‘Wanda,’ for it’s perfectly thrilling!” cried\\nCarrie, regretfully turning the crumpled leaves of the Seaside\\nLibrary copy of that interminable and impossible tale.\\n\\n“We should read to improve our minds, and that rubbish is only a\\nwaste of time,” began Alice, in a warning tone, as she looked up\\nfrom “Romola,” over which she had been poring with the delight one\\nfeels in meeting an old friend.\\n\\n“I don’t WISH to improve my mind, thank you: I read for amusement in\\nvacation time, and don’t want to see any moral works till next\\nautumn. I get enough of them in school. This isn’t ‘rubbish’! It’s\\nfull of fine descriptions of scenery--”\\n\\n“Which you skip by the page, I’ve seen you do it,” said Eva, the\\nthird young girl in the library, as she shut up the stout book on\\nher knee and began to knit as if this sudden outburst of chat\\ndisturbed her enjoyment of “The Dove in the Eagle’s Nest.”\\n\\n“I do at first, being carried away by my interest in the people, but\\nI almost always go back and read them afterward,” protested Carrie.\\n“You know YOU like to hear about nice clothes, Eva, and Wanda’s were\\nsimply gorgeous; white velvet and a rope of pearls is one costume;\\ngray velvet and a silver girdle another; and Idalia was all a\\n‘shower of perfumed laces,’ and scarlet and gold satin mask dresses,\\nor primrose silk with violets, so lovely! I do revel in ‘em!”\\n\\nBoth girls laughed as Carrie reeled off this list of elegances, with\\nthe relish of a French modiste.\\n\\n“Well, I’m poor and can’t have as many pretty things as I want, so\\nit IS delightful to read about women who wear white quilted satin\\ndressing-gowns and olive velvet trains with Mechlin lace sweepers to\\nthem. Diamonds as large as nuts, and rivers of opals and sapphires,\\nand rubies and pearls, are great fun to read of, if you never even\\nget a look at real ones. I don’t believe the love part does me a bit\\nof harm, for we never see such languid swells in America, nor such\\nlovely, naughty ladies; and Ouida scolds them all, so of course she\\ndoesn’t approve of them, and that’s moral, I’m sure.”\\n\\nBut Alice shook her head again, as Carrie paused out of breath, and\\nsaid in her serious way: “That’s the harm of it all. False and\\nfoolish things are made interesting, and we read for that, not for\\nany lesson there may be hidden under the velvet and jewels and fine\\nwords of your splendid men and women. Now, THIS book is a wonderful\\npicture of Florence in old times, and the famous people who really\\nlived are painted in it, and it has a true and clean moral that we\\ncan all see, and one feels wiser and better for reading it. I do\\nwish you’d leave those trashy things and try something really good.”\\n\\n“I hate George Eliot,--so awfully wise and preachy and dismal! I\\nreally couldn’t wade through ‘Daniel Deronda,’ though ‘The Mill on\\nthe Floss’ wasn’t bad,” answered Carrie, with another yawn, as she\\nrecalled the Jew Mordecai’s long speeches, and Daniel’s meditations.\\n\\n“I know you’d like this,” said Eva, patting her book with an air of\\ncalm content; for she was a modest, common-sense little body, full\\nof innocent fancies and the mildest sort of romance. “I love dear\\nMiss Yonge, with her nice, large families, and their trials, and\\ntheir pious ways, and pleasant homes full of brothers and sisters,\\nand good fathers and mothers. I’m never tired of them, and have read\\n‘Daisy Chain’ nine times at least.”\\n\\n“I used to like them, and still think them good for young girls,\\nwith our own ‘Queechy’ and ‘Wide, Wide World,’ and books of that\\nkind. Now I’m eighteen I prefer stronger novels, and books by great\\nmen and women, because these are always talked about by cultivated\\npeople, and when I go into society next winter I wish to be able to\\nlisten intelligently, and know what to admire.”\\n\\n“That’s all very well for you, Alice; you were always poking over\\nbooks, and I dare say you will write them some day, or be a\\nblue-stocking. But I’ve got another year to study and fuss over my\\neducation, and I’m going to enjoy myself all I can, and leave the\\nwise books till I come out.”\\n\\n“But, Carrie, there won’t be any time to read them; you’ll be so\\nbusy with parties, and beaux, and travelling, and such things. I\\nWOULD take Alice’s advice and read up a little now; it’s so nice to\\nknow useful things, and be able to find help and comfort in good\\nbooks when trouble comes, as Ellen Montgomery and Fleda did, and\\nEthel, and the other girls in Miss Yonge’s stories,” said Eva,\\nearnestly, remembering how much the efforts of those natural little\\nheroines had helped her in her own struggles tor self-control and\\nthe cheerful bearing of the burdens which come to all.\\n\\n“I don’t want to be a priggish Ellen, or a moral Fleda, and I do\\ndetest bothering about self-improvement all the time. I know I\\nought, but I’d rather wait another year or two, and enjoy my\\nvanities in peace just a LITTLE longer.” And Carrie tucked Wanda\\nunder the sofa pillow, as if a trifle ashamed of her society, with\\nEva’s innocent eyes upon her own, and Alice sadly regarding her over\\nthe rampart of wise books, which kept growing higher as the eager\\ngirl found more and more treasures in this richly stored library.\\n\\nA little silence followed, broken only by the patter of the rain\\nwithout, the crackle of the wood fire within, and the scratch of a\\nbusy pen from a curtained recess at the end of the long room. In the\\nsudden hush the girls heard it and remembered that they were not\\nalone.\\n\\n“She must have heard every word we said!” and Carrie sat up with a\\ndismayed face as she spoke in a whisper.\\n\\nEva laughed, but Alice shrugged her shoulders, and said tranquilly,\\n“I don’t mind. She wouldn’t expect much wisdom from school-girls.”\\n\\nThis was cold comfort to Carrie, who was painfully conscious of\\nhaving been a particularly silly school-girl just then. So she gave\\na groan and lay down again, wishing she had not expressed her\\nviews quite so freely, and had kept Wanda for the privacy of her own\\nroom.\\n\\nThe three girls were the guests of a delightful old lady, who had\\nknown their mothers and was fond of renewing her acquaintance with\\nthem through their daughters. She loved young people, and each\\nsummer invited parties of them to enjoy the delights of her\\nbeautiful country house, where she lived alone now, being the\\nchildless widow of a somewhat celebrated man. She made it very\\npleasant for her guests, leaving them free to employ a part of the\\nday as they liked, providing the best of company at dinner, gay\\nrevels in the evening, and a large house full of curious and\\ninteresting things to examine at their leisure.\\n\\nThe rain had spoiled a pleasant plan, and business letters had made\\nit necessary for Mrs. Warburton to leave the three to their own\\ndevices after lunch. They had read quietly for several hours, and\\ntheir hostess was just finishing her last letter when fragments of\\nthe conversation reached her ear. She listened with amusement,\\nunconscious that they had forgotten her presence, finding the\\ndifferent views very characteristic, and easily explained by the\\ndifference of the homes out of which the three friends came.\\n\\nAlice was the only daughter of a scholarly man and a brilliant\\nwoman; therefore her love of books and desire to cultivate her mind\\nwas very natural, but the danger in her case would be in the neglect\\nof other things equally important, too varied reading, and a\\nsuperficial knowledge of many authors rather than a true\\nappreciation of a few of the best and greatest. Eva was one of many\\nchildren in a happy home, with a busy father, a pious mother, and\\nmany domestic cares, as well as joys, already falling to the dutiful\\ngirl’s lot. Her instincts were sweet and unspoiled, and she only\\nneeded to be shown where to find new and better helpers for the real\\ntrials of life, when the childish heroines she loved could no longer\\nserve her in the years to come.\\n\\nCarrie was one of the ambitious yet commonplace girls who wish to\\nshine, without knowing the difference between the glitter of a\\ncandle which attracts moths, and the serene light of a star, or the\\ncheery glow of a fire round which all love to gather. Her mother’s\\naims were not high, and the two pretty daughters knew that she\\ndesired good matches for them, educated them for that end, and\\nexpected them to do their parts when the time came. The elder sister\\nwas now at a watering-place with her mother, and Carrie hoped that a\\nletter would soon come telling her that Mary was settled. During her\\nstay with Mrs. Warburton she had learned a good deal, and was\\nunconsciously contrasting the life here with the frivolous one at\\nhome, made up of public show and private sacrifice of comfort,\\ndignity, and peace. Here were people who dressed simply, enjoyed\\nconversation, kept up their accomplishments even when old, and were\\nso busy, lovable, and charming, that poor Carrie often felt vulgar,\\nignorant, and mortified among them, in spite of their fine breeding\\nand kindliness. The society Mrs. Warburton drew about her was the\\nbest, and old and young, rich and poor, wise and simple, all seemed\\ngenuine,---glad to give or receive, enjoy and rest, and then go out\\nto their work refreshed by the influences of the place and the sweet\\nold lady who made it what it was. The girls would soon begin life\\nfor themselves, and it was well that they had this little glimpse of\\nreally good society before they left the shelter of home to choose\\nfriends, pleasures, and pursuits for themselves, as all young women\\ndo when once launched.\\n\\nThe sudden silence and then the whispers suggested to the listener\\nthat she had perhaps heard something not meant for her ears; so she\\npresently emerged with her letters, and said, as she came smiling\\ntoward the group about the fire,--\\n\\n“How are you getting through this long, dull afternoon, my dears?\\nQuiet as mice till just now. What woke you up? A battle of the\\nbooks? Alice looks as if she had laid in plenty of ammunition, and\\nyou were preparing to besiege her.”\\n\\nThe girls laughed, and all rose, for Madam Warburton was a stately\\nold lady, and people involuntarily treated her with great respect,\\neven in this mannerless age.\\n\\n“We were only talking about books,” began Carrie, deeply grateful\\nthat Wanda was safely out of sight.\\n\\n“And we couldn’t agree,” added Eva, running to ring the bell for the\\nman to take the letters, for she was used to these little offices at\\nhome, and loved to wait on Madam.\\n\\n“Thanks, my love. Now let us talk a little, if you are tired of\\nreading, and if you like to let me share the discussion. Comparing\\ntastes in literature is always a pleasure, and I used to enjoy\\ntalking over books with my girl friends more than anything else.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton sat down in the chair which Alice\\nrolled up, drew Eva to the cushion at her feet, and nodded to the\\nothers as they settled again, with interested faces, one at the\\ntable where the pile of chosen volumes now lay, the other erect upon\\nthe couch where she had been practising the poses “full of languid\\ngrace,” so much affected by her favorite heroines.\\n\\n“Carrie was laughing at me for liking wise books and wanting to\\nimprove my mind. Is it foolish and a waste of time?” asked Alice,\\neager to convince her friend and secure so powerful an ally.\\n\\n“No, my dear, it is a very sensible desire, and I wish more girls\\nhad it. Only don’t be greedy, and read too much; cramming and\\nsmattering is as bad as promiscuous novel-reading, or no reading at\\nall. Choose carefully, read intelligently, and digest thoroughly\\neach book, and then you make it your own,” answered Mrs. Warburton,\\nquite in her element now, for she loved to give advice, as most old\\nladies do.\\n\\n“But how can we know WHAT to read if we mayn’t follow our tastes?”\\n said Carrie, trying to be interested and “intelligent” in spite of\\nher fear that a “school-marmy” lecture was in store for her.\\n\\n“Ask advice, and so cultivate a true and refined taste. I always\\njudge people’s characters a good deal by the books they like, as\\nwell as by the company they keep; so one should be careful, for this\\nis a pretty good test. Another is, be sure that whatever will not\\nbear reading aloud is not fit to read to one’s self. Many young\\ngirls ignorantly or curiously take up books quite worthless, and\\nreally harmful, because under the fine writing and brilliant color\\nlurks immorality or the false sentiment which gives wrong ideas of\\nlife and things which should be sacred. They think, perhaps, that no\\none knows this taste of theirs; but they are mistaken, for it shows\\nitself in many ways, and betrays them. Attitudes, looks, careless\\nwords, and a morbid or foolishly romantic view of certain things,\\nshow plainly that the maidenly instincts are blunted, and harm done\\nthat perhaps can never be repaired.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton kept her eyes fixed upon the tall andirons as if\\ngravely reproving them, which was a great relief to Carrie, whose\\ncheeks glowed as she stirred uneasily and took up a screen as if to\\nguard them from the fire. But conscience pricked her sharply, and\\nmemory, like a traitor, recalled many a passage or scene in her\\nfavorite books which she could not have read aloud even to that old\\nlady, though she enjoyed them in private. Nothing very bad, but\\nfalse and foolish, poor food for a lively fancy and young mind to\\nfeed on, as the weariness or excitement which always followed\\nplainly proved, since one should feel refreshed, not cloyed, with an\\nintellectual feast.\\n\\nAlice, with both elbows on the table, listened with wide-awake eyes,\\nand Eva watched the raindrops trickle clown the pane with an intent\\nexpression, as if asking herself if she had ever done this naughty\\nthing.\\n\\n“Then there is another fault,” continued Mrs. Warburton, well\\nknowing that her first shot had hit its mark, and anxious to be\\njust. “Some book-loving lassies have a mania for trying to read\\neverything, and dip into works far beyond their powers, or try too\\nmany different kinds of self-improvement at once. So they get a\\nmuddle of useless things into their heads, instead of well-assorted\\nideas and real knowledge. They must learn to wait and select; for\\neach age has its proper class of books, and what is Greek to us at\\neighteen may be just what we need at thirty. One can get mental\\ndyspepsia on meat and wine as well as on ice-cream and frosted cake,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice smiled, and pushed away four of the eight books she had\\nselected, as if afraid she had been greedy, and now felt that it was\\nbest to wait a little.\\n\\nEva looked up with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, “Now\\nit is my turn. Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to\\nRuskin, Kant, or Plato?”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton laughed, as she stroked the pretty brown head at her\\nknee.\\n\\n“Not yet, my love, perhaps never, for those are not the masters you\\nneed, I fancy. Since you like stories about every-day people, try\\nsome of the fine biographies of real men and women about whom you\\nshould know something. You will find their lives full of stirring,\\nhelpful, and lovely experiences, and in reading of these you will\\nget courage and hope and faith to bear your own trials as they come.\\nTrue stories suit you, and are the best, for there we get real\\ntragedy and comedy, and the lessons all must learn.”\\n\\n“Thank you! I will begin at once if you will kindly give me a list\\nof such as would be good for me,” cried Eva, with the sweet docility\\nof one eager to be all that is lovable and wise in woman.\\n\\n“Give us a list, and we will try to improve in the best way. You\\nknow what we need, and love to help foolish girls, or you wouldn’t\\nbe so kind and patient with us,” said Alice, going to sit beside\\nCarrie, hoping for much discussion of this, to her, very interesting\\nsubject.\\n\\n“I will, with pleasure; but I read few modern novels, so I may not\\nbe a good judge there. Most of them seem very poor stuff, and I\\ncannot waste time even to skim them as some people do. I still like\\nthe old-fashioned ones I read as a girl, though you would laugh at\\nthem. Did any of you ever read ‘Thaddeus of Warsaw’?”\\n\\n“I have, and thought it very funny; so were ‘Evelina’ and ‘Cecilia.’\\nI wanted to try Smollett and Fielding, after reading some fine\\nessays about them, but Papa told me I must wait,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Ah, my dears, in my day, Thaddeus was our hero, and we thought the\\nscene where he and Miss Beaufort are in the Park a most thrilling\\none. Two fops ask Thaddeus where he got his boots, and he replies,\\nwith withering dignity, ‘Where I got my sword, gentlemen.’ I\\ntreasured the picture of that episode for a long time. Thaddeus\\nwears a hat as full of black plumes as a hearse, Hessian boots with\\ntassels, and leans over Mary, who languishes on the seat in a\\nshort-waisted gown, limp scarf, poke bonnet, and large bag,--the height\\nof elegance then, but very funny now. Then William Wallace in ‘Scottish\\nChiefs.’ Bless me! we cried over him as much as you do over your ‘Heir\\nof Clifton,’ or whatever the boy’s name is. You wouldn’t get through it,\\nI fancy; and as for poor, dear, prosy Richardson, his letter-writing\\nheroines would bore you to death. Just imagine a lover saying to a\\nfriend, ‘I begged my angel to stay and sip one dish of tea. She sipped\\none dish and flew.’”\\n\\n“Now, I’m sure that’s sillier than anything the Duchess ever wrote\\nwith her five-o’clock teas and flirtations over plum-cake on lawns,”\\n cried Carrie, as they all laughed at the immortal Lovelace.\\n\\n“I never read Richardson, but he couldn’t be duller than Henry\\nJames, with his everlasting stories, full of people who talk a great\\ndeal and amount to nothing. _I_ like the older novels best, and\\nenjoy some of Scott’s and Miss Edgeworth’s better than Howells’s, or\\nany of the modern realistic writers, with their elevators, and\\npaint-pots, and every-day people,” said Alice, who wasted little\\ntime on light literature.\\n\\n“I’m glad to hear you say so, for I have an old-fashioned fancy that\\nI’d rather read about people as they were, for that is history, or\\nas they might and should be, for that helps us in our own efforts;\\nnot as they are, for that we know, and are all sufficiently\\ncommonplace ourselves, to be the better for a nobler and wider view\\nof life and men than any we are apt to get, so busy are we earning\\ndaily bread, or running after fortune, honor or some other bubble.\\nBut I mustn’t lecture, or I shall bore you, and forget that I am\\nyour hostess, whose duty it is to amuse.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton paused, Carrie, anxious to change the subject,\\nsaid, with her eyes on a curious jewel which the old lady wore, “I\\nalso like true stories, and you promised to tell us about that\\nlovely pin some day. This is just the time for it,--please do.”\\n\\n“With pleasure, for the little romance is quite apropos to our\\npresent chat. It is a very simple tale, and rather sad, but it had a\\ngreat influence on my life, and this brooch is very dear to me.”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Warburton sat silent a moment, the girls all looked with\\ninterest at the quaint pin which clasped the soft folds of muslin\\nover the black silk dress which was as becoming to the still\\nhandsome woman as the cap on her white hair and the winter roses in\\nher cheeks. The ornament was in the shape of a pansy; its purple\\nleaves were of amethyst, the yellow of topaz, and in the middle lay\\na diamond drop of dew. Several letters were delicately cut on its\\ngolden stem, and a guard pin showed how much its wearer valued it.\\n\\n“My sister Lucretia was a good deal older than I, for the three boys\\ncame between,” began Mrs. Warburton, still gazing at the fire, as if\\nfrom its ashes the past rose up bright and warm again. “She was a\\nvery lovely and superior girl, and I looked up to her with wonder as\\nwell as adoration. Others did the same, and at eighteen she was\\nengaged to a charming man, who would have made his mark had he\\nlived. She was too young to marry then, and Frank Lyman had a fine\\nopening to practise his profession at the South. So they parted for\\ntwo years, and it was then that he gave her the brooch, saying to\\nher, as she whispered how lonely she should be without him, ‘This\\nPENSEE is a happy, faithful THOUGHT of me. Wear it, dearest girl,\\nand don’t pine while we are separated. Read and study, write much to\\nme, and remember, “They never are alone that are accompanied with\\nnoble thoughts.”’”\\n\\n“Wasn’t that sweet?” cried Eva, pleased with the beginning of the\\ntale.\\n\\n“So romantic!” added Carrie, recalling the “amber amulet” one of her\\npet heroes wore for years, and died kissing, after he had killed\\nsome fifty Arabs in the desert.\\n\\n“Did she read and study?” asked Alice, with a soft color in her\\ncheek, and eager eyes, for a budding romance was folded away in the\\ndepths of her maidenly heart, and she liked a love story.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what she did, for it was rather remarkable at that\\nday, when girls had little schooling, and picked up accomplishments\\nas they could. The first winter she read and studied at home, and\\nwrote much to Mr. Lyman. I have their letters now, and very fine\\nones they are, though they would seem old-fashioned to you young\\nthings. Curious love letters,--full of advice, the discussion of\\nbooks, report of progress, glad praise, modest gratitude, happy\\nplans and a faithful affection that never wavered, though Lucretia\\nwas beautiful and much admired, and the dear fellow a great favorite\\namong the brilliant Southern women.\\n\\n“The second spring, Lucretia, anxious to waste no time, and\\nambitious to surprise Lyman, decided to go and study with old Dr.\\nGardener at Portland. He fitted young men for college, was a friend\\nof our father’s, and had a daughter who was a very wise and\\naccomplished woman. That was a very happy summer, and Lu got on so\\nwell that she begged to stay all winter. It was a rare chance, for\\nthere were no colleges for girls then, and very few advantages to be\\nhad, and the dear creature burned to improve every faculty, that she\\nmight be more worthy of her lover. She fitted herself for college\\nwith the youths there, and did wonders; for love sharpened her wits,\\nand the thought of that happy meeting spurred her on to untiring\\nexertion. Lyman was expected in May, and the wedding was to be in\\nJune; but, alas for the poor girl! the yellow-fever came, and he was\\none of the first victims. They never met again, and nothing was left\\nher of all that happy time but his letters, his library, and the\\npansy.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton paused to wipe a few quiet tears from her eyes, while\\nthe girls sat in sympathetic silence.\\n\\n“We thought it would kill her, that sudden change from love, hope,\\nand happiness to sorrow, death, and solitude. But hearts don’t\\nbreak, my dears, if they know where to go for strength. Lucretia\\ndid, and after the first shock was over found comfort in her books,\\nsaying, with a brave, bright look, and the sweetest resignation, ‘I\\nmust go on trying to be more worthy of him, for we shall meet again\\nin God’s good time and he shall see that I do not forget.’\\n\\n“That was better than tears and lamentation, and the long years that\\nfollowed were beautiful and busy ones, full of dutiful care for us\\nat home after our mother died, of interest in all the good works of\\nher time, and a steady, quiet effort to improve every faculty of her\\nfine mind, till she was felt to be one of the noblest women in our\\ncity. Her influence was wide-spread; all the intelligent people\\nsought her, and when she travelled she was welcome everywhere, for\\ncultivated persons have a free-masonry of their own, and are\\nrecognized at once.”\\n\\n“Did she ever marry?” asked Carrie, feeling that no life could be\\nquite successful without that great event.\\n\\n“Never. She felt herself a widow, and wore black to the day of her\\ndeath. Many men asked her hand, but she refused them all, and was\\nthe sweetest ‘old maid’ ever seen,--cheerful and serene to the very\\nlast, for she was ill a long time, and found her solace and stay\\nstill in the beloved books. Even when she could no longer read them,\\nher memory supplied her with the mental food that kept her soul\\nstrong while her body failed. It was wonderful to see and hear her\\nrepeating fine lines, heroic sayings, and comforting psalms through\\nthe weary nights when no sleep would come, making friends and\\nhelpers of the poets, philosophers, and saints whom she knew and\\nloved so well. It made death beautiful, and taught me how victorious\\nan immortal soul can be over the ills that vex our mortal flesh.\\n\\n“She died at dawn on Easter Sunday, after a quiet night, when she\\nhad given me her little legacy of letters, books, and the one jewel\\nshe had always worn, repeating her lover’s words to comfort me. I\\nhad read the Commendatory Prayer, and as I finished she whispered,\\nwith a look of perfect peace, ‘Shut the book, dear, I need study no\\nmore; I have hoped and believed, now I shall know;’ and so went\\nhappily away to meet her lover after patient waiting.”\\n\\nThe sigh of the wind was the only sound that broke the silence till\\nthe quiet voice went on again, as if it loved to tell the story, for\\nthe thought of soon seeing the beloved sister took the sadness from\\nthe memory of the past.\\n\\n“I also found my solace in books, for I was very lonely when she was\\ngone, my father being dead, the brothers married, and home desolate.\\nI took to study and reading as a congenial employment, feeling no\\ninclination to marry, and for many years was quite contented among\\nmy books. But in trying to follow in dear Lucretia’s footsteps, I\\nunconsciously fitted myself for the great honor and happiness of my\\nlife, and curiously enough I owed it to a book.”\\n\\nMrs. Warburton smiled as she took up a shabby little volume from the\\ntable where Alice had laid it, and, quick to divine another romance,\\nEva said, like a story-loving child, “Do tell about it! The other\\nwas so sad.”\\n\\n“This begins merrily, and has a wedding in it, as young girls think\\nall tales should. Well, when I was about thirty-five, I was invited\\nto join a party of friends on a trip to Canada, that being the\\nfavorite jaunt in my young days. I’d been studying hard for some\\nyears, and needed rest, so I was glad to go. As a good book for an\\nexcursion, I took this Wordsworth in my bag. It is full of fine\\npassages, you know, and I loved it, for it was one of the books\\ngiven to Lucretia by her lover. We had a charming time, and were on\\nour way to Quebec when my little adventure happened. I was in\\nraptures over the grand St. Lawrence as we steamed slowly from\\nMontreal that lovely summer day. I could not read, but sat on the\\nupper deck, feasting my eyes and dreaming dreams as even staid\\nmaiden ladies will when out on a holiday. Suddenly I caught the\\nsound of voices in earnest discussion on the lower deck, and,\\nglancing down, saw several gentlemen leaning against the rail as\\nthey talked over certain events of great public interest at that\\nmoment. I knew that a party of distinguished persons were on\\nboard, as my friend’s husband, Dr. Tracy, knew some of them, and\\npointed out Mr. Warburton as one of the rising scientific men of the\\nday. I remembered that my sister had met him years ago, and much\\nadmired him both for his own gifts and because he had known Lyman.\\nAs other people were listening, I felt no delicacy about doing the\\nsame, for the conversation was an eloquent one, and well worth\\ncatching. So interested did I become that I forgot the great rafts\\nfloating by, the picturesque shores, the splendid river, and leaned\\nnearer and nearer that no word might be lost, till my book slid out\\nof my lap and fell straight down upon the head of one of the\\ngentlemen, giving him a smart blow, and knocking his hat overboard.”\\n\\n“Oh, what DID you do?” cried the girls, much amused at this\\nunromantic catastrophe.\\n\\nMrs. Warburton clasped her hands dramatically, as her eyes twinkled\\nand a pretty color came into her cheeks at the memory of that\\nexciting moment.\\n\\n“My dears, I could have dropped with mortification! What COULD I do\\nbut dodge and peep as I waited to see the end of this most untoward\\naccident? Fortunately I was alone on that side of the deck, so none\\nof the ladies saw my mishap and, slipping along the seat to a\\ndistant corner, I hid my face behind a convenient newspaper, as I\\nwatched the little flurry of fishing up the hat by a man in a boat\\nnear by, and the merriment of the gentlemen over this assault of\\nWilliam Wordsworth upon Samuel Warburton. The poor book passed from\\nhand to hand, and many jokes were made upon the ‘fair Helen’ whose\\nname was written on the paper cover which projected it.\\n\\n“‘I knew a Miss Harper once,--a lovely woman, but her name was not\\nHelen, and she is dead,--God bless her!’ I heard Mr. Warburton say,\\nas he flapped his straw hat to dry it, and rubbed his head, which\\nfortunately was well covered with thick gray hair at that time.\\n\\n“I longed to go down and tell him who I was, but I had not the\\ncourage to face all those men. It really was MOST embarrassing; so I\\nwaited for a more private moment to claim my book, as I knew we\\nshould not land till night, so there was no danger of losing it.\\n\\n“‘This is rather unusual stuff for a woman to be reading. Some\\nliterary lady doubtless. Better look her up, Warburton. You’ll know\\nher by the color of her stockings when she comes down to lunch,’\\nsaid a jolly old gentlenoan, in a tone that made me ‘rouge high,’ as\\nEvelina says.\\n\\n“‘I shall know her by her intelligent face and conversation, if this\\nbook belongs to a lady. It will be an honor and a pleasure to meet a\\nwoman who enjoys Wordsworth, for in my opinion he is one of our\\ntruest poets,’ answered Mr. Warburton, putting the book in his\\npocket, with a look and a tone that were most respectful and\\ncomforting to me just then.\\n\\n“I hoped he would examine the volume, for Lucretia’s and Lyman’s\\nnames were on the fly leaf, and that would be a delightful\\nintroduction for me. So I said nothing and bided my time, feeling\\nrather foolish when we all filed in to lunch, and I saw the other\\nparty glancing at the ladies at the table. Mr. Warburton’s eye\\npaused a moment as it passed from Mrs. Tracy to me, and I fear I\\nblushed like a girl, my dears, for Samuel had very fine eyes, and I\\nremembered the stout gentleman’s unseemly joke about the stockings.\\nMine were white as snow, for I had a neat foot, and was fond of nice\\nhose and well-made shoes. I am so still, as you see.” Here the old\\nlady displayed a small foot in a black silk stocking and delicate\\nslipper, with the artless pride a woman feels, at any age, in one of\\nher best points. The girls gratified her by a murmur of admiration,\\nand, decorously readjusting the folds of her gown, she went on with\\nthe most romantic episode of her quiet life.\\n\\n“I retired to my state-room after lunch to compose myself, and when\\nI emerged, in the cool of the afternoon, my first glance showed me\\nthat the hour had come, for there on deck was Mr. Warburton, talking\\nto Mrs. Tracy, with my book in his hand. I hesitated a moment, for\\nin spite of my age I was rather shy, and really it was not an easy\\nthing to apologize to a strange gentle-man for dropping books on\\nhis head and spoiling his hat. Men think so much of their hats you\\nknow. I was spared embarrassment, however, for he saw me and came to\\nme at once, saying, in the most cordial manner, as he showed the\\nnames on the fly leaf of my Wordsworth, ‘I am sure we need no other\\nintroduction but the names of these two dear friends of ours. I am\\nvery glad to find that Miss Helen Harper is the little girl I saw\\nonce or twice at your father’s house some years ago, and to meet her\\nso pleasantly again.’\\n\\n“That made everything easy and delightful, and when I had apologized\\nand been laughingly assured that he considered it rather an honor\\nthan otherwise to be assaulted by so great a man, we fell to talking\\nof old times, and soon forgot that we were strangers. He was twenty\\nyears older than I, but a handsome man, and a most interesting and\\nexcellent one, as we all know. He had lost a young wife long ago,\\nand had lived for science ever since, but it had not made him dry,\\nor cold, or selfish. He was very young at heart for all his wisdom,\\nand enjoyed that holiday like a boy out of school. So did I, and\\nnever dreamed that anything would come of it but a pleasant\\nfriendship founded on our love for those now dead and gone. Dear me!\\nhow strangely things turn out in this world of ours, and how the\\ndropping of that book changed my life! Well, that was our\\nintroduction, and that first long conversation was followed by many\\nmore equally charming, during the three weeks our parties were much\\ntogether, as both were taking the same trip, and Dr. Tracy was glad\\nto meet his old friend.\\n\\n“I need not tell you how delightful such society was to me, nor how\\nsurprised I was when, on the last day before we parted, Mr.\\nWarburton, who had answered many questions of mine during these long\\nchats of ours, asked me a very serious one, and I found that I could\\nanswer it as he wished. It brought me great honor as well as\\nhappiness. I fear I was not worthy of it, but I tried to be, and\\nfelt a tender satisfaction in thinking that I owed it to dear\\nLucretia, in part at least; for my effort to imitate her made me\\nfitter to become a wise man’s wife, and thirty years of very sweet\\ncompanionship was my reward.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Warburton bowed her head before the portrait of a\\nvenerable old man which hung above the mantel-piece.\\n\\nIt was a pretty, old-fashioned expression of wifely pride and\\nwomanly tenderness in the fine old lady, who forgot her own gifts,\\nand felt only humility and gratitude to the man who had found in her\\na comrade in intellectual pursuits, as well as a helpmeet at home\\nand a gentle prop for his declining years.\\n\\nThe girls looked up with eyes full of something softer than mere\\ncuriosity, and felt in their young hearts how precious and honorable\\nsuch a memory must be, how true and beautiful such a marriage was,\\nand how sweet wisdom might become when it went hand in hand with\\nlove.\\n\\nAlice spoke first, saying, as she touched the worn cover of the\\nlittle book with a new sort of respect, “Thank you very much!\\nPerhaps I ought not to have taken this from the corner shelves in\\nyour sanctum? I wanted to find the rest of the lines Mr. Thornton\\nquoted last night, and didn’t stop to ask leave.”\\n\\n“You are welcome, my love, for you know how to treat books. Yes,\\nthose in that little case are my precious relics. I keep them all,\\nfrom my childish hymn-book to my great-grandfather’s brass-bound\\nBible, for by and by when I sit ‘Looking towards Sunset,’ as dear\\nLydia Maria Child calls our last days, I shall lose my interest in\\nother books, and take comfort in these. At the end as at the\\nbeginning of life we are all children again, and love the songs our\\nmothers sung us, and find the one true Book our best teacher as we\\ndraw near to God.”\\n\\nAs the reverent voice paused, a ray of sunshine broke through the\\nparting clouds, and shone full on the serene old face turned to meet\\nit, with a smile that welcomed the herald of a lovely sunset.\\n\\n“The rain is over; there will be just time for a run in the garden\\nbefore dinner, girls. I must go and change my cap, for literary\\nladies should not neglect to look well after the ways of their\\nhousehold and keep themseves tidy, no matter how old they may be.”\\n And with a nod Mrs. Warburton left them, wondering what the effect\\nof the conversation would be on the minds of her young guests.\\n\\nAlice went away to the garden, thinking of Lucretia and her lover,\\nas she gathered flowers in the sunshine. Conscientious Eva took the\\nLife of Mary Somerville to her room, and read diligently for half an\\nhour, that no time might be lost in her new course of study, Carrie\\nsent Wanda and her finery up the chimney in a lively blaze, and, as\\nshe watched the book burn, decided to take her blue and gold volume\\nof Tennyson with her on her next trip to Nahant, in case any\\neligible learned or literary man’s head should offer itself as a\\nshining mark. Since a good marriage was the end of life, why not\\nfollow Mrs. Warburton’s example, and make a really excellent one?\\n\\nWhen they all met at dinner-time the old lady was pleased to see a\\nnosegay of fresh pansies in the bosoms of her three youngest guests,\\nand to hear Alice whisper, with grateful eyes,--\\n\\n“We wear your flower to show you that we don’t mean to forget the\\nlesson you so kindly gave us, and to fortify ourselves with ‘noble\\nthoughts,’ as you and she did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWATER-LILIES\\n\\n\\nA PARTY of people, young and old, sat on the piazza of a seaside\\nhotel one summer morning, discussing plans for the day as they\\nwaited for the mail.\\n\\n“Hullo! here comes Christie Johnstone,” exclaimed one of the young\\nmen perched on the railing, who was poisoning the fresh air with the\\nsickly scent of a cigarette.\\n\\n“So ‘tis, with ‘Flucker, the baddish boy,’ in tow, as large as\\nlife,” added another, with a pleasant laugh as he turned to look.\\n\\nThe new-comers certainly looked somewhat like Charles Reade’s\\npicturesque pair, and every one watched them with idle interest as\\nthey drew nearer. A tall, robust girl of seventeen, with dark eyes\\nand hair, a fine color on her brown cheek, and vigor in every\\nmovement, came up the rocky path from the beach with a basket of\\nlobsters on one arm, of fish on the other, and a wicker tray of\\nwater-lilies on her head. The scarlet and silver of the fish\\ncontrasted prettily with the dark blue of her rough dress, and the\\npile of water flowers made a fitting crown for this bonny young\\nfish-wife. A sturdy lad of twelve came lurching after her in a pair\\nof very large rubber boots, with a dilapidated straw hat on the back\\nof his head and a pail on either arm.\\n\\nStraight on went the girl, never turning head or eyes as she passed\\nthe group on the piazza and vanished round the corner, though it was\\nevident that she heard the laugh the last speech produced, for the\\ncolor deepened in her cheeks and her step quickened. The boy,\\nhowever, returned the glances bent upon him, and answered the smiles\\nwith such a cheerful grin that the youth with the cigarette called\\nout,--\\n\\n“Good-morning, Skipper! Where do you hail from?”\\n\\n“Island, yender,” answered the boy, with a gesture of his thumb over\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\n“Oh, you are the lighthouse-keeper, are you?”\\n\\n“No, I ain’t; me and Gramper’s fishermen now.”\\n\\n“Your name is Flucker Johnstone, and your sister’s Christie, I\\nthink?” added the youth, enjoying the amusement of the young ladies\\nabout him.\\n\\n“It’s Sammy Bowen, and hern’s Ruth.”\\n\\n“Have you got a Boaz over there for her?”\\n\\n“No, we’ve got a devil-fish, a real whacker.”\\n\\nThis unexpected reply produced a roar from the gentlemen, while the\\nboy grinned good-naturedly, though without the least idea what the\\njoke was. Pretty Miss Ellery, who had been told that she had “a\\nrippling laugh,” rippled sweetly as she leaned over the railing to\\nask,\\n\\n“Are those lilies in your pails? I want some if they are for sale.”\\n\\n“Sister’ll fetch ‘em round when she’s left the lobs. I ain’t got\\nnone; this is bait for them fellers.” And, as if reminded of\\nbusiness by the yells of several boys who had just caught sight of\\nhim, Sammy abruptly weighed anchor and ran before the wind toward\\nthe stable.\\n\\n“Funny lot, these natives! Act as if they owned the place and are as\\nstupid as their own fish,” said the youth in the white yachting\\nsuit, as he flung away his cigarette end.\\n\\n“Don’t agree with you, Fred. I’ve known people of this sort all my\\nlife and a finer set of honest, hardworking, independent men I never\\nmet,--brave as lions and tender as women in spite of their rough\\nways,” answered the other young man, who wore blue flannel and had a\\ngold band on his cap.\\n\\n“Sailors and soldiers always stand by one another; so of course you\\nsee the best side of these fellows, Captain. The girls are fine\\ncreatures, I grant you; but their good looks don’t last long, more’s\\nthe pity!”\\n\\n“Few women’s would with the life they lead, so full of hard work,\\nsuspense, and sorrow. No one knows till one is tried, how much\\ncourage and faith it takes to keep young and happy when the men one\\nloves are on the great sea,” said a quiet, gray-haired lady, as she\\nlaid her hand on the knee of the young man in blue with a look that\\nmade him smile affectionately at her, with his own brown hand on\\nhers.\\n\\n“Shouldn’t wonder if Ben Bowen was laid up, since the girl brings\\nthe fish. He’s a fine old fellow. I’ve been to No Man’s Land many a\\ntime blue-fishing with him; must ask after him,” said an elderly\\ngentleman who was pacing to and fro yearning for the morning papers.\\n\\n“We might go over to the island and have a chowder-party or a\\nfish-fry some moonlight night. I haven’t been here for several\\nyears, but it used to be great fun, and I suppose we can do it now,”\\n suggested Miss Ellery with the laugh.\\n\\n“By Jove, we will! And look up Christie; ask her when she comes\\nround,” said Mr. Fred, the youthful dude, untwining his languid legs\\nas if the prospect put a little life into him.\\n\\n“Of course we pay for any trouble we give; these people will do\\nanything for money,” began Miss Ellery; but Captain John, as they\\ncalled the sailor, held up his hand with a warning, “Hush! she’s\\ncoming,” as Ruth’s weather-beaten brown hat turned the corner.\\n\\nShe paused a moment to drop the empty baskets, shake her skirts, and\\nput up a black braid that had fallen down; then, with the air of one\\nresolved to do a distasteful task as quickly as possible, she came\\nup the steps, held out the rough basket cover, and said in a clear\\nvoice,--\\n\\n“Would any of the ladies like some fresh lilies? Ten cents a bunch.”\\n\\nA murmur from the ladies expressed their admiration of the beautiful\\nflowers, and the gentlemen pressed forward to buy and present every\\nbunch with gallant haste. Ruth’s eyes shone as the money fell into\\nher hand, and several voices begged her to bring more lilies while\\nthey lasted.\\n\\n“I didn’t know the darlings would grow in salt water,” said Miss\\nEllery, as she fondly gazed upon the cluster Mr. Fred had just\\noffered her.\\n\\n“They don’t. There’s a little fresh-water pond on our island, and\\nthey grow there,--only place for miles round;” and Ruth looked at\\nthe delicate girl in ruffled white lawn and a mull hat, with a\\nglance of mingled pity for her ignorance and admiration for her\\nbeauty.\\n\\n“How silly of me! I am SUCH a goose;” and Miss Ellery gurgled as she\\nhid her face behind her red parasol.\\n\\n“Ask about the fish-fry,” whispered Mr. Fred, putting his head\\nbehind the rosy screen to assure the pretty creature that he didn’t\\nknow any better himself.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I will!” and, quite consoled, Miss Ellery called out,\\n“Girl, will you tell me if we can have chowder-parties on your rocks\\nas we used to a few seasons ago?”\\n\\n“If you bring your own fish. Grandpa is sick and can’t get ‘em for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“We will provide them, but who will cook them for us? It’s such\\nhorrid work.”\\n\\n“Any one can fry fish! I will if you want me to;” and Ruth half\\nsmiled, remembering that this girl who shuddered at the idea of pork\\nand a hot frying-pan, used to eat as heartily as any one when the\\ncrisp brown cunners were served up.\\n\\n“Very good; then we’ll engage you as cook, and come over to-night if\\nit’s clear and our fishing prospers. Don’t forget a dozen of the\\nfinest lilies for this lady to-morrow morning. Pay you now, may not\\nbe up;” and Mr. Fred dropped a bright silver dollar into the basket\\nwith a patronizing air, intended to impress this rather too\\nindependent young person with a proper sense of inferiority.\\n\\nRuth quietly shook the money out upon the door-mat, and said with a\\nsudden sparkle in her black eyes,--\\n\\n“It’s doubtful if I bring any more. Better wait till I do.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry your grandfather is sick. I’ll come over and see him\\nby-and-by, and bring the papers if he would like some,” said the\\nelderly gentleman as he came up with a friendly nod and real\\ninterest in his face.\\n\\n“Very much, thank you, sir. He is very feeble now;” and Ruth turned\\nwith a bright smile to welcome kind Mr. Wallace, who had not\\nforgotten the old man.\\n\\n“Christie has got a nice little temper of her own, and don’t know\\nhow to treat a fellow when he wants to do her a favor,” growled Mr.\\nFred, pocketing his dollar with a disgusted air.\\n\\n“She appears to know how to treat a gentleman when HE offers one,”\\n answered Blue Jacket, with a twinkle of the eye as if he enjoyed the\\nother’s discomfiture.\\n\\n“Girls of that class always put on airs if they are the least bit\\npretty,--so absurd!” said Miss Ellery, pulling up her long gloves as\\nshe glanced at the brown arms of the fisher maiden.\\n\\n“Girls of any class like to be treated with respect. Modesty in\\nlinsey-woolsey is as sweet as in muslin, my dear, and should be even\\nmore admired, according to my old-fashioned way of thinking,” said\\nthe gray-haired lady.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” murmured her sailor nephew with an approving nod.\\n\\nIt was evident that Ruth had heard also, as she turned to go, for\\nwith a quick gesture she pulled three great lilies from her hat and\\nlaid them on the old lady’s lap, saying with a grateful look, “Thank\\nyou, ma’am.”\\n\\nShe had seen Miss Scott hand her bunch to a meek little governess\\nwho had been forgotten, and this was all she had to offer in return\\nfor the kindness which is so sweet to poor girls whose sensitive\\npride gets often wounded by trifles like these.\\n\\nShe was going without her baskets when Captain John swung himself\\nover the railing, and ran after her with them. He touched his cap as\\nhe met her, and was thanked with as bright a smile as that the elder\\ngentleman had received; for his respectful “Miss Bowen” pleased her\\nmuch after the rude “Girl!” and the money tossed to her as if she\\nwere a beggar. When he came back the mail had arrived, and all\\nscattered at once,--Mr. Fred to spend the dollar in more cigarettes,\\nand Captain John to settle carefully in his button-hole the\\nwater-lily Aunt Mary gave him, before both young men went off to\\nplay tennis as if their bread depended on it.\\n\\nAs it bid fair to be a moonlight night, the party of a dozen young\\npeople, with Miss Scott and Mr. Wallace to act as matron and admiral\\nof the fleet, set off to the Island about sunset. Fish in abundance\\nhad been caught, and a picnic supper provided to be eaten on the\\nrocks when the proper time arrived. They found Sammy, in a clean\\nblue shirt and a hat less like a Feejee headpiece, willing to do the\\nhonors of the Island, beaming like a freckled young merman as he\\npaddled out to pull up the boats.\\n\\n“Fire’s all ready for kindlin’, and Ruth’s slicin’ the pertaters.\\nHope them fish is cleaned?” he added with a face of deep anxiety;\\nfor that weary task would fall to him if not already done, and the\\nthought desolated his boyish soul.\\n\\n“All ready, Sam! Lend a hand with these baskets, and then steer for\\nthe lighthouse; the ladies want to see that first,” answered Captain\\nJohn, as he tossed a stray cookie into Sammy’s mouth with a smile\\nthat caused that youth to cleave to him like a burr all the evening.\\n\\nThe young people scattered over the rocks, and hastened to visit the\\npoints of interest before dark. They climbed the lighthouse tower,\\nand paid Aunt Nabby and Grandpa a call at the weather-beaten little\\nhouse, where the old woman lent them a mammoth coffee-pot, and\\npromised that Ruth would “dish up them fish in good shape at eight\\npunctooal.” Then they strolled away to see the fresh-water pond\\nwhere the lilies grew.\\n\\n“How curious that such a thing should be here right in the middle of\\nthe salt sea!” said one of the girls, as they stood looking at the\\nquiet pool while the tide dashed high upon the rocks all about them.\\n\\n“Not more curious than how it is possible for anything so beautiful\\nand pure as one of those lilies to grow from the mud at the bottom\\nof the pond. The ugly yellow ones are not so out of place; but no\\none cares for them, and they smell horridly,” added another girl in\\na reflective tone.\\n\\n“Instinct sends the white lily straight up to the sun and air, and\\nthe strong slender stem anchors it to the rich earth below, out of\\nwhich it has power to draw the nourishment that makes it so lovely\\nand keeps it spotless--unless slugs and flies and boys spoil it,”\\n added Miss Scott as she watched Mr. Fred poke and splash with his\\ncane after a half-closed flower.\\n\\n“The naughty things have all shut up and spoilt the pretty sight;\\nI’m so disappointed,” sighed Miss Ellery, surveying the green buds\\nwith great disfavor as she had planned to wear some in her hair and\\nact Undine.\\n\\n“You must come early in the morning if you want to see them at their\\nbest. I’ve read somewhere that when the sun first strikes them they\\nopen rapidly, and it is a lovely sight. I shall try to see it some\\nday if I can get here in time,” said Miss Scott.\\n\\n“How romantic old maids are!” whispered one girl to another.\\n\\n“So are young ones; hear what Floss Ellery is saying,” answered the\\nother; and both giggled under their big hats as they caught these\\nwords followed by the rippling laugh,--\\n\\n“All flowers open and show their hearts when the sun shines on them\\nat the right moment.”\\n\\n“I wish human flowers would,” murmured Mr. Fred; and then, as if\\nrather alarmed at his own remark, he added hastily, “I’ll get that\\nbig lily out there and MAKE it bloom for you.”\\n\\nTrusting to an old log that lay in the pond, he went to the end and\\nbent to pull in the half-shut flower; but this too ardent sun was\\nnot to make it blossom, for his foot slipped and down he went up to\\nhis knees in mud and water.\\n\\n“Save him! oh, save him!” shrieked Miss Ellery, clutching Captain\\nJohn, who was laughing like a boy, while the other lads shouted and\\nthe girls added their shrill merriment as poor Fred scrambled to the\\nshore a wreck of the gallant craft that had set sail in spotless\\nwhite.\\n\\n“What the deuce shall I do?” he asked in a tone of despair as they\\nflocked about him to condole even while they laughed.\\n\\n“Roll up your trousers and borrow Sam’s boots. The old lady will dry\\nyour shoes and socks while you are at supper, and have them ready to\\nwear home,” suggested Captain John, who was used to duckings and\\nmade light of them.\\n\\nThe word “supper” made one carnal-minded youth sniff the air and\\nannounce that he smelt “something good;” and at once every one\\nturned toward the picnic ground, like chickens hurrying to the barn\\nat feeding-time. Fred vanished into the cottage, and the rest\\ngathered about the great fire of driftwood fast turning to clear\\ncoals, over which Ruth was beginning her long hot task. She wore a\\nbig apron, a red handkerchief over her head, had her sleeves rolled\\nup, and was so intent on her work that she merely nodded and smiled\\nas the new-comers greeted her with varying degrees of courtesy.\\n\\n“She looks like a handsome gypsy, with her dark face and that red\\nthing in the firelight. I wish I could paint her,” said Miss Scott,\\nwho was very young at heart in spite of her fifty years and gray\\nhead.\\n\\n“So do I, but we can remember it. I do like to see a girl work with\\na will, even at frying fish. Most of ‘em dawdle so at the few things\\nthey try to do. There’s a piece of energy for you!” and Captain John\\nleaned forward from his rocky seat to watch Ruth, who just then\\ncaught up the coffee-pot about to boil over, and with the other hand\\nsaved her frying-pan from capsizing on its unsteady bed of coals.\\n\\n“She is a nice girl, and I’m much interested in her. Mr. Wallace\\nsays he will tell us her story by-and-by if we care to hear it. He\\nhas known the old man a long time.”\\n\\n“Don’t forget to remind him, Aunty. I like a yarn after mess;” and\\nCaptain John went off to bring the first plate of fish to the dear\\nold lady who had been a mother to him for many years.\\n\\nIt was a merry supper, and the moon was up before it ended; for\\neverything “tasted so good” the hearty young appetites sharpened by\\nsea air were hard to satisfy. When the last cunner had vanished and\\nnothing but olives and oyster crackers remained, the party settled\\non a sloping rock out of range of the fire, and reposed for a brief\\nperiod to recover from the exertions of the feast, having, like the\\nheroes in the old story, “eaten mightily for the space of an hour.”\\n\\nMr. Fred in the capacious boots was a never-failing source of\\namusement, and consequently somewhat subdued. But Miss Ellery\\nconsoled him, and much food sustained him till his shoes were dry.\\nRuth remained to clear up, and Sammy to gorge himself on the\\nremnants of “sweet cake” which he could not bear to see wasted. So,\\nwhen some one proposed telling stories till they were ready to sing,\\nMr. Wallace was begged to begin.\\n\\n“It is only something about this island, but you may like to hear it\\njust now,” said the genial old gentleman, settling his handkerchief\\nover his bald head for fear of cold, and glancing at the attentive\\nyoung faces grouped about him in the moonlight.\\n\\n“Some twenty years ago there was a wreck over there on those great\\nrocks; you fellows have heard about it, so I’ll only say that a very\\nbrave sailor, a native of the Port here, swam out with a rope and\\nsaved a dozen men and women. I’ll call him Sam. Well, one of the\\nwomen was an English governess, and when the lady she was with went\\non her way after the wreck, this pretty girl (who by the way was a\\ngood deal hurt trying to save the child she had in charge) was left\\nbehind to recover, and--”\\n\\n“Marry the brave sailor of course,” cried one of the girls.\\n\\n“Exactly! and a very happy pair they were. She had no family who\\nwanted her at home; her father had been a clergyman, I believe, and\\nshe was well born, but Sam was a fine fellow and earned his living\\nhonestly, fishing off the Banks, as half the men do here. Well, they\\nwere very happy, had two children, and were saving up a bit, when\\npoor Sam and two brothers were lost in one of the great storms which\\nnow and then make widows and orphans by the dozen. It killed the\\nwife; but Sam’s father, who kept the lighthouse here then, took the\\npoor children and supported them for ten years. The boy was a mere\\nbaby; the girl a fine creature, brave like her father, handsome like\\nher mother, and with a good deal of the lady about her, though every\\none didn’t find it out.”\\n\\n“Ahem!” cried the sharp girl, who began to understand the point of\\nthe story now, but would not spoil it, as the others seemed still in\\nthe dark, though Miss Scott was smiling, and Captain John staring\\nhard at the old gentleman in the blue silk nightcap.\\n\\n“Got a fly in your throat?” asked a neighbor; but Kate only laughed\\nand begged pardon for interrupting.\\n\\n“There’s not much more; only that affair was rather romantic, and\\none can’t help wondering how the children turned out. Storms seem to\\nhave been their doom, for in the terrible one we had two winters\\nago, the old lighthouse keeper had a bad fall on the icy rocks, and\\nif it had not been for the girl, the light would have gone out and\\nmore ships been lost on this dangerous point. The keeper’s mate had\\ngone ashore and couldn’t get back for two days, the gale raged so\\nfiercely; but he knew Ben could get on without him, as he had the\\ngirl and boy over for a visit. In winter they lived with a friend\\nand went to school at the Port. It would have been all right if Ben\\nhadn’t broken his ribs. But he was a stout old salt; so he told the\\ngirl what to do, and she did it, while the boy waited on the sick\\nman. For two days and nights that brave creature lived in the tower,\\nthat often rocked as if it would come down, while the sleet and snow\\ndimmed the lantern, and sea-birds were beaten to death against the\\nglass. But the light burned steadily, and people said, ‘All is\\nwell,’ as ships steered away in time, when the clear light warned\\nthem of danger, and grateful sailors blessed the hands that kept it\\nburning faithfully.”\\n\\n“I hope she got rewarded,” cried an eager voice, as the story-teller\\npaused for breath.\\n\\n“‘I only did my duty; that is reward enough,’ she said, when some of\\nthe rich men at the Port heard of it and sent her money and thanks.\\nShe took the money, however, for Ben had to give up the place, being\\ntoo lame to do the work. He earns his living by fishing now, and\\nputs away most of his pension for the children. He won’t last long,\\nand then they must take care of themselves; for the old woman is no\\nrelation, and the girl is too proud to hunt up the forgetful English\\nfriends, if they have any. But I don’t fear for her; a brave lass\\nlike that will make her own way anywhere.”\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked several voices, as Mr. Wallace leaned back and\\nfanned himself with his hat.\\n\\n“That’s all of the first and second parts; the third is yet to come.\\nWhen I know it, I’ll tell you; perhaps next summer, if we meet here\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Then you know the girl? What is she doing now?” asked Miss Ellery,\\nwho had lost a part of the story as she sat in a shadowy nook with\\nthe pensive Fred.\\n\\n“We all know her. She is washing a coffee-pot at this moment, I\\nbelieve;” and Mr. Wallace pointed to a figure on the beach,\\nenergetically shaking a large tin article that shone in the\\nmoonlight.\\n\\n“Ruth? Really? How romantic and interesting!” exclaimed Miss Ellery,\\nwho was just of the age, as were most of the other girls, to enjoy\\ntales of this sort and imagine sensational denouements.\\n\\n“There is a great deal of untold romance in the lives of these\\ntoilers of the sea, and I am sure this good girl will find her\\nreward for the care she takes of the old man and the boy. It costs\\nher something, I’ve discovered, for she wants an education, and\\ncould get it if she left this poor place and lived for herself; but\\nshe won’t go, and works hard to get money for Grandpa’s comfort,\\ninstead of buying the books she longs for. I think, young ladies,\\nthat there is real heroism in cheerfully selling lilies and frying\\nfish for duty’s sake when one longs to be studying, and enjoying a\\nlittle of the youth that comes but once,” said Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes, so nice of her! We might take up a contribution for\\nher when we get home. I’ll head the paper with pleasure and give all\\nI can afford, for it must be so horrid to be ignorant at her age. I\\ndare say the poor thing can’t even read; just fancy!” and Miss\\nEllery clasped her hands with a sigh of pity.\\n\\n“Very few girls can read fit to be heard now-a-days,” murmured Miss\\nScott.\\n\\n“Don’t let them affront her with their money; she will fling it in\\ntheir faces as she did that donkey’s dollar. You see to her in your\\nnice, delicate way, Aunty, and give her a lift if she will let you,”\\n whispered Captain John in the old lady’s ear.\\n\\n“Don’t waste your pity, Miss Florence. Ruth reads a newspaper better\\nthan any woman I ever knew. I’ve heard her doing it to the old man,\\ngetting through shipping news, money-market, and politics in fine\\nstyle. I wouldn’t offer her money if I were you, though it is a kind\\nthought. These people have an honest pride in earning things for\\nthemselves, and I respect them for it,” added Mr. Wallace.\\n\\n“Dear me! I should as soon think of a sand skipper having pride as\\none of these fishy folks in this stupid little place,” observed Mr.\\nFred, moving his legs into the shadow as the creeping moonlight\\nbegan to reveal the hideous boots.\\n\\n“Why not? I think they have more to be proud of, these brave,\\nhonest, independent people, than many who never earn a cent and\\nswell round on the money their fathers made out of pork, rum,\\nor--any other rather unpleasant or disreputable business,” said\\nCaptain John, with the twinkle in his eye, as he changed the end of\\nhis sentence, for the word “pickles” was on his lips when Aunt\\nMary’s quick touch checked it. Some saucy girl laughed, and Mr. Fred\\nsquirmed, for it was well known that his respectable grandfather\\nwhom he never mentioned had made his large fortune in a\\npickle-factory.\\n\\n“We all rise from the mud in one sense, and all may be handsome\\nflowers if we choose before we go back, after blooming, to ripen our\\nseeds at the bottom of the water where we began,” said Miss Scott’s\\nrefined voice, sounding softly after the masculine ones.\\n\\n“I like that idea! Thank you, Aunt Mary, for giving me such a pretty\\nfancy to add to my love for water-lilies. I shall remember it, and\\ntry to be a lovely one, not a bit ashamed to own that I came from\\nhonest farmer stock,” exclaimed the thoughtful girl who had learned\\nto know and love the sweet, wise woman who was so motherly to all\\ngirls.\\n\\n“Hear! hear!” cried Captain John, heartily; for he was very proud of\\nhis own brave name kept clean and bright through a long line of\\nsailor kin.\\n\\n“Now let us sing or we shall have no time,” suggested Miss Ellery,\\nwho warbled as well as rippled, and did not wish to lose this\\nopportunity of singing certain sentimental songs appropriate to the\\nhour.\\n\\nSo they tuned their pipes and made “music in the air” for an hour,\\nto the great delight of Sammy, who joined in every song, and was\\neasily persuaded to give sundry nautical melodies in a shrill small\\nvoice which convulsed his hearers with merriment.\\n\\n“Ruth sings awful well, but she won’t afore folks,” he said, as he\\npaused after a roaring ditty.\\n\\n“She will for me;” and Mr. Wallace went slowly up to the rock not\\nfar away, where Ruth sat alone listening to the music as she rested\\nafter her long day’s work.\\n\\n“Such airs!” said Miss Ellery, in a sharp tone; for her “Wind of the\\nSummer Night” had not gone well, owing to a too copious supper.\\n“Posing for Lorelei,” she added, as Ruth began to sing, glad to\\noblige the kind old gentleman. They expected some queer ballad or\\ndroning hymn, and were surprised when a clear sweet voice gave them\\n“The Three Fishers” and “Mary on the Sands of Dee” with a simple\\npathos that made real music-lovers thrill with pleasure, and filled\\nseveral pairs of eyes with tears.\\n\\n“More, please, more!” called Captain John, as she paused; and as if\\nencouraged by the hearty applause her one gift excited, she sang on\\nas easily as a bird till her small store was exhausted.\\n\\n“I call THAT music,” said Miss Scott, as she wiped her eyes with a\\nsigh of satisfaction. “It comes from the heart and goes to the\\nheart, as it should. Now we don’t want anything else, and had better\\ngo home while the spell lasts.”\\n\\nMost of the party followed her example, and went to thank and say\\ngood-night to Ruth, who felt as rich and happy as a queen with the\\nmoney Mr. Wallace had slipped into her pocket, and the pleasure\\nwhich even this short glimpse of a higher, happier life had brought\\nher hungry nature.\\n\\nAs the boats floated away, leaving her alone on the shore, she sent\\nher farewell ringing over the water in the words of the old song, “A\\nLife on the Ocean Wave;” and every one joined in it with a will,\\nespecially Mr. Wallace and Captain John; and so the evening picnic\\nended tunefully and pleasantly for all, and was long remembered by\\nseveral.\\n\\nAfter that day many “good times” came to Ruth and Sammy; and even\\npoor old Grandpa had his share, finding the last summer of his life\\nvery smooth sailing as he slowly drifted into port. It seemed quite\\nnatural that Captain John, being a sailor, should like to go and\\nread and “yarn” with the old fisherman; so no one wondered when he\\nfell into the way of rowing over to the Island very often with his\\npocket full of newspapers, and whiling away the long hours in the\\nlittle house as full of sea smells and salt breezes as a shell on\\nthe shore.\\n\\nMiss Scott also took a fancy to go with her nephew; for, being an\\nardent botanist, she discovered that the Island possessed many\\nplants which she could not find on the rocky point of land where the\\nhotel and cottages stood. The fresh-water pond was her especial\\ndelight, and it became a sort of joke to ask, when she came home\\nbrown and beaming with her treasures in tin boxes, bottles, and\\nbunches,--\\n\\n“Well, Aunt Mary, have you seen the water-lilies bloom yet?” and\\nshe always answered with that wise smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Not yet, but I’m biding my time, and am watching a very fine one\\nwith especial interest. When the right moment comes, it will bloom\\nand show its golden heart to me, I hope.”\\n\\nRuth never quite knew how it came about, but books seemed to find\\ntheir way to the Island and stay there, to her great delight. A\\ndemand for lilies sprang up, and when their day was over\\nmarsh-rosemary became the rage. Sammy found a market for all the\\nshells and gulls’ wings he could furnish, and certain old\\ncuriosities brought from many voyages were sold for sums which added\\nmany comforts to the old sailor’s last cruise.\\n\\nNow the daily row to the Point was a pleasure, not a trial, to\\nRuth,--for Mr. Wallace was always ready with a kind word or gift,\\nthe ladies nodded as she passed, and asked how the old Skipper was\\nto-day; Miss Scott often told her to stop at the cottage for some\\nnew book or a moment’s chat on her way to the boat, and Captain John\\nhelped Sammy with his fishing so much that the baskets were always\\nfull when they came home.\\n\\nAll this help and friendliness put a wonderful energy and sweetness\\ninto Ruth’s hard life, and made her work seem light, her patient\\nwaiting for freedom easier to bear cheerfully. She sang as she stood\\nover her wash-tub, cheered the long nights of watching with the\\nprecious books, and found the few moments of rest that came to her\\nwhen the day’s work was done very pleasant, as she sat on her rock,\\nwatching the lights from the Point, catching the sound of gay music\\nas the young people danced, and thinking over the delightful talks\\nshe had with Miss Scott. Perhaps the presence of a blue jacket in\\nGrandpa’s little bedroom, the sight of a friendly brown face smiling\\nwhen she came in, and the sonorous murmur of a man’s voice reading\\naloud, added a charm to the girl’s humdrum life. She was too\\ninnocent and frank to deny that she enjoyed these new friends, and\\nwelcomed both with the same eagerness, saw both go with the same\\nregret, and often wondered how she ever had got on without them.\\n\\nBut the modest fisher-maiden never dreamed of any warmer feeling\\nthan kindness on the one side and gratitude on the other; and this\\nunconsciousness was her greatest charm, especially to Captain John,\\nwho hated coquettes, and shunned the silly girls who wasted time in\\nidle flirtation when they had far better and wholesomer pastimes to\\nenjoy. The handsome sailor was a favorite, being handy at all sorts\\nof fun, and the oldest of the young men at the Point. He was very\\ncourteous in his hearty way to every woman he met, from the\\nstateliest dowager to the dowdiest waiter-girl, but devoted himself\\nentirely to Aunt Mary, and seemed to have no eyes for younger fairer\\nfaces.\\n\\n“He must have a sweetheart over the sea somewhere,” the damsels said\\namong themselves, as they watched him pace the long piazzas alone,\\nor saw him swinging in his hammock with eyes dreamily fixed on the\\nblue bay before him.\\n\\nMiss Scott only smiled when curious questions were asked her, and\\nsaid she hoped John would find his mate some time, for he deserved\\nthe best wife in the world, having been a good son and an honest boy\\nfor six-and-twenty years.\\n\\n“What is it, Captain,--a steamer?” asked Mr. Fred, as he came by the\\ncottage one August afternoon, with his usual escort of girls, all\\ntalking at once about some very interesting affair.\\n\\n“Only a sail-boat; no steamers to-day,” answered Captain John,\\ndropping the glass from his eye with a start.\\n\\n“Can you see people on the Island with that thing? We want to know\\nif Ruth is at home, because if she isn’t we can’t waste time going\\nover,” said Miss Ellery, with her sweetest smile.\\n\\n“I think not. That boat is Sammy’s, and as there is a speck of red\\naboard, I fancy Miss Ruth is with him. They are coming this way, so\\nyou can hail them if you like,” answered the sailor, with “a speck\\nof red” on his own sunburnt cheek if any one had cared to look.\\n\\n“Then we’ll wait here if we may. We ordered her to bring us a\\nquantity of bulrushes and flowers for our tableaux to-night, and we\\nwant her to be Rebecca at the well. She is so dark, and with her\\nhair down, and gold bangles and scarlet shawls, I think she would do\\nnicely. It takes so long to arrange the ‘Lily Maid of Astolat’ we\\nMUST have an easy one to come just before that, and the boys are\\nwild to make a camel of themselves, so we planned this. Won’t you be\\nJacob or Abraham or whoever the man with the bracelets was?” asked\\nMiss Ellery, as they all settled on the steps in the free-and-easy\\nway which prevailed at the Point.\\n\\n“No, thank you, I don’t act. Used to dance hornpipes in my young\\ndays, but gave up that sort of thing some time ago.”\\n\\n“How unfortunate! Every one acts; it’s all the fashion,” began Miss\\nEllery, rolling up her blue eyes imploringly.\\n\\n“So I see; but I never cared much for theatricals, I like natural\\nthings better.”\\n\\n“How unkind you are! I quite depended on you for that, since you\\nwouldn’t be a corsair.”\\n\\n“Fred’s the man for such fun. He’s going to startle the crowd with a\\nregular Captain Kidd rig, pistols and cutlasses enough for a whole\\ncrew, and a terrific beard.”\\n\\n“I know Ruth won’t do it, Floss, for she looked amazed when I showed\\nher my Undine costume, and told her what I wanted the sea-weed for.\\n‘Why, you won’t stand before all those folks dressed that way, will\\nyou?’ she said, as much scandalized as if she’d never seen a\\nlow-necked dress and silk stockings before;” and Miss Perry tossed\\nher head with an air of pity for a girl who could be surprised at\\nthe display of a pretty neck and arms and ankles.\\n\\n“We’ll HIRE her, then; she’s a mercenary wretch and will do anything\\nfor money. I won’t be scrambled into my boat in a hurry, and we MUST\\nhave Rebecca because I’ve borrowed a fine pitcher and promised the\\nboys their camel,” said Miss Ellery, who considered herself the\\nqueen of the place and ruled like one, in virtue of being the\\nprettiest girl there and the richest.\\n\\n“She has landed, I think, for the boat is off again to the wharf.\\nBetter run down and help her with the bulrushes, Fred, and the rest\\nof the stuff you ordered,” suggested Captain John, longing to go\\nhimself but kept by his duty as host, Aunt Mary being asleep\\nupstairs.\\n\\n“Too tired. Won’t hurt her; she’s used to work, and we mustn’t\\npamper her up, as old ladies say,” answered Mr. Fred, enjoying his\\nfavorite lounge on the grass.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t ask her to act, if you’ll allow me to say so,” said\\nCaptain John, in his quiet way. “That sort of thing might unsettle\\nher and make her discontented. She steers that little craft over\\nthere and is happy now; let her shape her own course, and remember\\nit isn’t well to talk to the man at the wheel.”\\n\\nMiss Perry stared; Miss Ray, the sharp girl, nodded, and Miss Ellery\\nsaid petulantly,--\\n\\n“As if it mattered what SHE thought or said or did! It’s her place\\nto be useful if we want her, and we needn’t worry about spoiling a\\ngirl like that. She can’t be any prouder or more saucy than she is,\\nand I shall ask her if only to see the airs she will put on.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ruth came up the sandy path from the beach laden with\\nrushes and weeds, sun-flowers and shells, looking warm and tired\\nbut more picturesque than ever, in her blue gown and the red\\nhandkerchief she wore since her old hat blew away. Seeing the party\\non the cottage steps, she stopped to ask if the things were right,\\nand Miss Ellery at once made her request in a commanding tone which\\ncaused Ruth to grow very straight and cool and sober all at once,\\nand answer decidedly,--\\n\\n“I couldn’t anyway.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Well, one reason is I don’t think it’s right to act things out of\\nthe Bible just to show off and amuse folks.”\\n\\n“The idea of minding!” and Miss Ellery frowned, adding angrily, “We\\nwill pay you for it. I find people will do anything for money down\\nhere.”\\n\\n“We are poor and need it, and this is our best time to make it. I’d\\ndo most anything to earn a little, but not that;” and Ruth looked as\\nproud as the young lady herself.\\n\\n“Then we’ll say no more if you are too elegant to do what WE don’t\\nmind at all. I’ll pay you for this stuff now, as I ordered it, and\\nyou needn’t bring me any more. How much do I owe you?” asked the\\noffended beauty, taking out her purse in a pet.\\n\\n“Nothing. I’m glad to oblige the ladies if I can, for they have been\\nvery kind to me. Perhaps if you knew why I want to earn money, you’d\\nunderstand me better. Grandpa can’t last long, and I don’t want the\\ntown to bury him. I’m working and saving so he can be buried\\ndecently, as he wants to be, not like a pauper.”\\n\\nThere was something in Ruth’s face and voice as she said this,\\nstanding there shabby, tired, and heavy-laden, yet honest, dutiful\\nand patient for love’s sake, that touched the hearts of those who\\nlooked and listened; but she left no time for any answer, for with\\nthe last word she went on quickly, as if to hide the tears that\\ndimmed her clear eyes and the quiver of her lips.\\n\\n“Floss, how could you!” cried Miss Ray, and ran to take the sheaf of\\nbulrushes from Ruth’s arms, followed by the rest, all ashamed and\\nrepentant now that a word had shown them the hard life going on\\nbeside their idle, care-free ones.\\n\\nCaptain John longed to follow, but walked into the house, growling\\nto himself with a grim look,--\\n\\n“That girl has no more heart than a butterfly, and I’d like to see\\nher squirm on a pin! Poor Ruth! we’ll settle that matter, and bury\\nold Ben like an admiral, hang me if we don’t!”\\n\\nHe was so busy talking the affair over with Aunt Mary that he did\\nnot see the girl flit by to wait for her boat on the beach, having\\nsteadily refused the money offered her, though she accepted the\\napologies in the kindest spirit.\\n\\nThe beach at this hour of the day was left to the nurses and maids\\nwho bathed and gossiped while the little people played in the sand\\nor paddled in the sea. Several were splashing about, and one German\\ngoverness was scolding violently because while she was in the\\nbath-house her charge, a little girl of six, had rashly ventured out\\nin a flat-bottomed tub, as they called the small boats used by the\\ngentlemen to reach the yachts anchored in deep water.\\n\\nRuth saw the child’s danger at a glance, for the tide was going out,\\ncarrying the frail cockleshell rapidly away, while the child risked\\nan upset every moment by stretching her arms to the women on the\\nshore and calling them to help her.\\n\\nNone dared to try, but all stood and wrung their hands, screaming\\nlike sea-gulls, till the girl, throwing off shoes and heavy skirt\\nplunged in, calling cheerily, “Sit still! I’ll come and get you,\\nMilly!”\\n\\nShe could swim like a fish, but encumbered with her clothes and\\nweary with an unusually hard day’s work, she soon found that she did\\nnot gain as rapidly as she expected upon the receding boat. She did\\nnot lose courage, but a thrill of anxiety shot through her as she\\nfelt her breath grow short, her limbs heavy, and the tide sweep her\\nfarther and farther from the shore.\\n\\n“If they would only stop screaming and go for help, I could keep up\\nand push the boat in; but the child will be out presently and then\\nwe are lost, for I can’t get back with her, I’m afraid.”\\n\\nAs these thoughts passed through her mind Ruth was swimming stoutly,\\nand trying by cheerful words to keep the frightened child from\\nrisking their main chance of safety. A few more strokes and she\\nwould reach the boat, rest a moment, then, clinging to it, push it\\nleisurely to shore. Feeling that the danger was over, she hurried on\\nand was just putting up her hands to seize the frail raft and get\\nher breath when Milly, thinking she was to be taken in her arms,\\nleaned forward. In rushed the water, down went the boat, and out\\nsplashed the screaming child to cling to Ruth with the desperate\\nclutch she dreaded.\\n\\nBoth went under for a moment, but rose again; and with all her wits\\nsharpened by the peril of the moment, Ruth cried, as she kept\\nherself afloat,--\\n\\n“On my back, quick! quick! Don’t touch my arms; hold tight to my\\nhair, and keep still.”\\n\\nNot realizing all the danger, and full of faith in Ruth’s power to\\ndo anything, after the feats of diving and floating she had seen her\\nperform, Milly scrambled up as often before, and clung spluttering\\nand gasping to Ruth’s strong shoulders. So burdened, and conscious\\nof fast-failing strength, Ruth turned toward the shore, and bent\\nevery power of mind and body to her task. How far away it seemed!\\nhow still the women were,--not one even venturing out a little way\\nto help her, and no man in sight! Her heart seemed to stop beating,\\nher temples throbbed, her breath was checked by the clinging arms,\\nand the child, seemed to grow heavier every moment.\\n\\n“I’ll do what I can, but, oh, why don’t some one come?”\\n\\nThat was the last thought Ruth was conscious of, as she panted and\\nploughed slowly back, with such a set white face and wide eyes fixed\\non the flag that fluttered from the nearest cottage, that it was no\\nwonder the women grew still as they watched her. One good Catholic\\nnurse fell on her knees to pray; the maids cried, the governess\\nmurmured, “Mein Gott, I am lost if the child go drowned!” and clear\\nand sweet came the sound of Captain John’s whistle as he stood on\\nhis piazza waiting to row Ruth home.\\n\\nThey were nearly in, a few more strokes and she could touch the\\nbottom, when suddenly all grew black before her eyes, and\\nwhispering, “I’ll float. Call, Milly, and don’t mind me,” Ruth\\nturned over, still holding the child fast, and with nothing but her\\nface out of water, feebly struggled on.\\n\\n“Come and get me! She’s going down! Oh, come, quick!” called the\\nchild in a tone of such distress that the selfish German bestirred\\nherself at last, and began to wade cautiously in. Seeing help at\\nhand, brave little Milly soon let go, and struck out like an\\nenergetic young frog, while Ruth, quite spent, sank quietly down,\\nwith a dim sense that her last duty was done and rest had come.\\n\\nThe shrill cries of the women when they saw the steady white face\\ndisappear and rise no more, reached Captain John’s ear, and sent him\\nflying down the path, sure that some one was in danger.\\n\\n“Ruth--gone down--out there!” was all he caught, as many voices\\ntried to tell the tale; and waiting for no more, he threw off hat\\nand coat, and dashed into the sea as if ready to search the Atlantic\\ntill he found her.\\n\\nShe was safe in a moment, and pausing only to send one girl flying\\nfor the doctor, he carried his streaming burden straight home to\\nAunt Mary, who had her between blankets before a soul arrived, and\\nwas rubbing for dear life while John fired up the spirit lamp for\\nhot brandy and water, with hands that trembled as he splashed about\\nlike an agitated Newfoundland fresh from a swim.\\n\\nRuth was soon conscious, but too much exhausted to do or say\\nanything, and lay quietly suffering the discomforts of resuscitation\\ntill she fell asleep.\\n\\n“Is Milly safe?” was all she asked, and being assured that the child\\nwas in her mother’s arms, and Sammy had gone to tell Grandpa all\\nabout it, she smiled and shut her eyes with a whispered, “Then it’s\\nall right, thank God!”\\n\\nAll that evening Captain John paced the piazza, and warned away the\\neager callers, who flocked down to ask about the heroine of the\\nhour; for she was more interesting than Undine, the Lily Maid, or\\nany of the pretty creatures attitudinizing behind the red curtains\\nin the hot hotel parlor. All that night Aunt Mary watched the deep\\nsleep that restored the girl, and now and then crept out to tell her\\nnephew there was nothing to fear for one so strong and healthful.\\nAnd all night Ruth dreamed strange dreams, some weird and dim, some\\nfull of pain and fear; but as the fever of reaction passed away,\\nlovely visions of a happy place came to her, where faces she loved\\nwere near, and rest, and all she longed for was hers at last. So\\nclear and beautiful was this dream that she waked in the early dawn\\nto lie and think of it, with such a look of peace upon her face that\\nAunt Mary could not but kiss it tenderly when she came in to see if\\nall was well.\\n\\n“How are you, dear? Has this nice long sleep set you up again as I\\nhoped?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’m quite well, thank you, and I must go home. Grandpa will\\nworry so till he sees me,” answered Ruth, sitting up with her wet\\nhair on her shoulders, and a little shiver of pain as she stretched\\nher tired arms.\\n\\n“Not yet, my dear; rest another hour or two and have some breakfast.\\nThen, if you like, John shall take you home before any one comes to\\nplague you with idle questions. I’m not going to say a word, except\\nthat I’m proud of my brave girl, and mean to take care of her if she\\nwill let me.”\\n\\nWith that and a motherly embrace, the old lady bustled away to stir\\nup her maid and wake John from his first nap with the smell of\\ncoffee, a most unromantic but satisfying perfume to all the weary\\nwatchers in the house.\\n\\nAn hour later, dressed in Miss Scott’s gray wrapper and rose-colored\\nshawl, Ruth came slowly to the beach leaning on Captain John’s arm,\\nwhile Aunt Mary waved her napkin from the rocks above, and sent kind\\nmessages after them as they pushed off.\\n\\nIt was the loveliest hour of all the day. The sun had not yet risen,\\nbut sea and sky were rosy with the flush of dawn; the small waves\\nrippled up the sand, the wind blew fresh and fragrant from hayfields\\nfar away, and in the grove the birds were singing, as they only sing\\nat peep of day. A still, soft, happy time before the work and worry\\nof the world began, the peaceful moment which is so precious to\\nthose who have learned to love its balm and consecrate its beauty\\nwith their prayers.\\n\\nRuth sat silent, looking about her as if she saw a new heaven and\\nearth, and had no words in which to tell the feeling that made her\\neyes so soft, sent the fresh color back into her cheeks, and touched\\nher lips with something sweeter than a smile.\\n\\nCaptain John rowed very slowly, watching her with a new expression\\nin his face; and when she drew a long breath, a happy sort of sigh,\\nhe leaned forward to ask, as if he knew what brought it,--\\n\\n“You are glad to be alive, Ruth?”\\n\\n“Oh, so glad! I didn’t want to die; life’s very pleasant now,” she\\nanswered, with her frank eyes meeting his so gratefully.\\n\\n“Even though it’s hard?”\\n\\n“It’s easier lately; you and dear Miss Mary have helped so much, I\\nsee my way clear, and mean to go right on, real brave and cheerful,\\nsure I’ll get my wish at last.”\\n\\n“So do I!” and Captain John laughed a queer, happy laugh, as he bent\\nto his oars again, with the look of a man who knew where he was\\ngoing and longed to get there as soon as possible.\\n\\n“I hope you will. I wish I could help anyway to pay for all you’ve\\ndone for me. I know you don’t want to be thanked for fishing me up,\\nbut I mean to do it all the same, if I can, some time;” and Ruth’s\\nvoice was full of tender energy as she looked down into the deep\\ngreen water where her life would have ended but for him.\\n\\n“What did you think of when you went down so quietly? Those women\\nsaid you never called for help once.”\\n\\n“I had no breath to call. I knew you were near, I hoped you’d come,\\nand I thought of poor Grandpa and Sammy as I gave up and seemed to\\ngo to sleep.”\\n\\nA very simple answer, but it made Captain John beam with delight;\\nand the morning red seemed to glow all over his brown face as he\\nrowed across the quiet bay, looking at Ruth sitting opposite, so\\nchanged by the soft becoming colors of her dress, the late danger,\\nand the dreams that still lingered in her mind, making it hard to\\nfeel that she was the same girl who went that way only a day ago.\\n\\nPresently the Captain spoke again in a tone that was both eager and\\nanxious,--\\n\\n“I’m glad my idle summer hasn’t been quite wasted. It’s over now,\\nand I’m off in a few days for a year’s cruise, you know.”\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Mary told me you were going soon. I’ll miss you both, but\\nmaybe you’ll come next year?”\\n\\n“I will, please God!”\\n\\n“So will I; for even if I get away this fall, I’d love to come again\\nin summer and rest a little while, no matter what I find to do.”\\n\\n“Come and stay with Aunt Mary if this home is gone. I shall want\\nSammy next time. I’ve settled that with the Skipper, you know, and\\nI’ll take good care of the little chap. He’s not much younger than I\\nwas when I shipped for my first voyage. You’ll let him go?”\\n\\n“Anywhere with you. He’s set his heart on being a sailor, and\\nGrandpa likes it. All our men are, and I’d be one if I were a boy. I\\nlove the sea so, I couldn’t be happy long away from it.”\\n\\n“Even though it nearly drowned you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I’d rather die that way than any other. But it was my fault; I\\nshouldn’t have failed if I hadn’t been so tired. I’ve often swum\\nfarther; but I’d been three hours in the marsh getting those things\\nfor the girls, and it was washing-day, and I’d been up nearly all\\nnight with Grandpa; so don’t blame the sea, please, Captain John.”\\n\\n“You should have called me; I was waiting for you, Ruth.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know it. I’m used to doing things myself. It might have\\nbeen too late for Milly if I’d waited.”\\n\\n“Thank God, I wasn’t too late for you.”\\n\\nThe boat was at the shore now; and as he spoke Captain John held out\\nhis hands to help Ruth down, for, encumbered with her long dress,\\nand still weak from past suffering, she could not spring to land as\\nshe used to do in her short gown. For the first time the color\\ndeepened in her cheek as she looked into the face before her and\\nread the meaning of the eyes that found her beautiful and dear, and\\nthe lips that thanked God for her salvation so fervently.\\n\\nShe did not speak, but let him lift her down, draw her hand through\\nhis arm, and lead her up the rocky slope to the little pool that lay\\nwaiting for the sun’s first rays to wake from its sleep. He paused\\nthere, and with his hand on hers said quietly,--\\n\\n“Ruth, before I go I want to tell you something, and this is a good\\ntime and place. While Aunt Mary watched the flowers, I’ve watched\\nyou, and found the girl I’ve always wanted for my wife. Modest and\\nbrave, dutiful and true, that’s what I love; could you give me all\\nthis, dear, for the little I can offer, and next year sail with\\nSammy and a very happy man if you say yes?”\\n\\n“I’m not half good and wise enough for that! Remember what I am,”\\n began Ruth, bending her head as if the thought were more than she\\ncould bear.\\n\\n“I do remember, and I’m proud of it! Why, dear heart, I’ve worked my\\nway up from a common sailor, and am the better for it. Now I’ve got\\nmy ship, and I want a mate to make a home for me aboard and ashore.\\nLook up and tell me that I didn’t read those true eyes wrong.”\\n\\nThen Ruth lifted up her face, and the sunshine showed him all he\\nasked to know, as she answered with her heart in her voice and the\\n“true eyes” fixed on his,--\\n\\n“I tried not to love you, knowing what a poor ignorant girl I am;\\nbut you were so kind to me, how could I help it, John?”\\n\\nThat satisfied him, and he sealed his happy thanks on the innocent\\nlips none had kissed but the little brother, the old man, and the\\nfresh winds of the sea.\\n\\nOne can imagine the welcome they met at the small brown house, and\\nwhat went on inside as Grandpa blessed the lovers, and Sammy so\\noverflowed with joy at his enchanting prospects, that he was obliged\\nto vent his feelings in ecstatic jigs upon the beach, to the great\\namazement of the gulls and sandpipers at breakfast there.\\n\\nNo one at the Point, except a certain dear old lady, knew the\\npleasant secret, though many curious or friendly visitors went to\\nthe Island that day to see the heroine and express their wonder,\\nthanks, and admiration. All agreed that partial drowning seemed to\\nsuit the girl, for a new Ruth had risen like Venus from the sea. A\\nsofter beauty was in her fresh face now, a gentler sort of pride\\npossessed her, and a still more modest shrinking from praise and\\npublicity became her well. No one guessed the cause, and she was\\nsoon forgotten; for the season was over, the summer guests departed,\\nand the Point was left to the few cottagers who loved to linger into\\ngolden September.\\n\\nMiss Mary was one of these, and Captain John another; for he\\nremained as long as he dared, to make things comfortable for the old\\nman, and to sit among the rocks with Ruth when her day’s work was\\ndone, listening while his “Mermaid,” as he called her, sang as she\\nhad never sung before, and let him read the heart he had made his\\nown, for the lily was wide open now, and its gold all his.\\n\\nWith the first frosts Grandpa died, and was carried to his grave by\\nhis old comrades, owing no man a cent, thanks to his dutiful\\ngranddaughter and the new son she had given him. Then the little\\nhouse was deserted, and all winter Ruth was happy with Aunt Mary,\\nwhile Sammy studied bravely, and lived on dreams of the joys in\\nstore for him when the Captain came sailing home again.\\n\\nAnother summer brought the happy day when the little brown house was\\nset in order for a sailor’s honeymoon, when the flag floated gayly\\nover Miss Mary’s cottage, and Ruth in a white gown with her chosen\\nflowers in her hair and bosom, shipped with her dear Captain for the\\nlong cruise which had its storms and calms, but never any shipwreck\\nof the love that grew and blossomed with the water-lilies by the\\nsea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOPPIES AND WHEAT\\n\\n\\nAS the great steamer swung round into the stream the cloud of white\\nhandkerchiefs waving on the wharf melted away, the last good-byes\\ngrew fainter, and those who went and those who stayed felt that the\\nparting was over,--\\n\\n“It may be for years, and it may be forever,”\\n\\nas the song says.\\n\\nWith only one of the many groups on the deck need we concern\\nourselves, and a few words will introduce our fellow-travellers. A\\nbrisk middle-aged lady leaned on the arm of a middle-aged gentleman\\nin spectacles, both wearing the calmly cheerful air of people used\\nto such scenes, and conscious only of the relief change of place\\nbrings to active minds and busy lives.\\n\\nBefore them stood two girls, evidently their charges, and as\\nevidently not sisters, for in all respects they were a great\\ncontrast. The younger was a gay creature of seventeen, in an\\neffective costume of navy-blue and white, with bright hair blowing\\nin the wind, sparkling eyes roving everywhere, lively tongue going,\\nand an air of girlish excitement pleasant to see. Both hands were\\nfull of farewell bouquets, which she surveyed with more pride than\\ntenderness as she glanced at another group of girls less blessed\\nwith floral offerings.\\n\\nHer companion was a small, quiet person, some years older than\\nherself, very simply dressed, laden with wraps, and apparently\\nconscious just then of nothing but three dark specks on the wharf,\\nas she still waved her little white flag, and looked shoreward with\\neyes too dim for seeing. A sweet, modest face it was, with\\nintelligent eyes, a firm mouth, and the look of one who had early\\nlearned self-reliance and self-control.\\n\\nThe lady and gentleman watched the pair with interest and amusement;\\nfor both liked young people, and were anxious to know these two\\nbetter, since they were to be their guides and guardians for six\\nmonths. Professor Homer was going abroad to look up certain\\nimportant facts for his great historical work, and as usual took his\\nwife with him; for they had no family, and the good lady was ready\\nto march to any quarter of the globe at short notice. Fearing to be\\nlonely while her husband pored over old papers in foreign libraries,\\nMrs. Homer had invited Ethel Amory, a friend’s daughter, to\\naccompany her. Of course the invitation was gladly accepted, for it\\nwas a rare opportunity to travel in such company, and Ethel was wild\\nwith delight at the idea. One thorn, however, vexed her, among\\nthe roses with which her way seemed strewn. Mamma would not let her\\ntake a French maid, but preferred a young lady as companion; for,\\nthree being an awkward number, a fourth party would be not only\\nconvenient, but necessary on the girl’s account, since she was not\\nused to take care of herself and Mrs. Homer could only be expected\\nto act as chaperone.\\n\\n“Jane Bassett is just the person I want, and Jane shall go. She\\nneeds a change after teaching all these years; it will do her a\\nworld of good, for she will improve and enjoy every moment, and the\\nsalary I shall offer her will make it worth her while,” said Mrs.\\nAmory, as she discussed the plan with her daughter.\\n\\n“She is only three years older than I am, and I hate to be taken\\ncare of, and watched, and fussed over. I can order a maid round, but\\na companion is worse than a governess; such people are always\\nsensitive and proud, and hard to get on with. Every one takes a\\nmaid, and I’d set my heart on that nice Marie who wants to go home,\\nand talks such lovely French. Do let me have her, Mamma!” begged\\nEthel, who was a spoiled child and usually got her own way.\\n\\nBut for once Mamma stood firm, having a strong desire to benefit her\\ndaughter by the society of better companions than the gay girls of\\nher own set, also to give a great pleasure to good little Jane\\nBassett, who had been governessing ever since she was sixteen, with\\nvery few vacations in her hard, dutiful life.\\n\\n“No, darling, I have asked Jane, and if her mother can spare her,\\nJane it shall be. She is just what you need,--sensible and kind,\\nintelligent and capable; not ashamed to do anything for you, and\\nable to teach you a great deal in a pleasant way. Mrs. Homer\\napproves of her, and I am sure you will be glad by-and-by; for\\ntravelling is not all ‘fun,’ as you expect, and I don’t want you to\\nbe a burden on our friends. You two young things can take care of\\neach other while the Professor and his wife are busy with their own\\naffairs; and Jane is a far better companion for you than that\\ncoquettish French woman, who will probably leave you in the lurch as\\nsoon as you reach Paris. I shouldn’t have a moment’s peace if you\\nwere left with her, but I have entire confidence in Jane Bassett\\nbecause she is faithful, discreet, and a true lady in all things.”\\n\\nThere was no more to be said, and Ethel pouted in vain. Jane\\naccepted the place with joy; and after a month of delightful hurry\\nthey were off, one all eagerness for the new world, the other full\\nof tender regret for the dear souls left behind. How they got on,\\nand what they learned, remains to be told.\\n\\n“Come, Miss Bassett, we can’t see them any longer, so we may as well\\nbegin to enjoy ourselves. You might take those things down below,\\nand settle the stateroom a bit; I’m going to walk about and get my\\nbearings before lunch. You will find me somewhere round.”\\n\\nEthel spoke with a little tone of command, having made up her mind\\nto be mistress and keep Jane Bassett in her place, though she did\\nknow three languages and sketched much better than Miss Amory.\\n\\nJenny, as we who are going to be her bosom friends will call her,\\nnodded cheerfully, and looked about for the stairway; for, never\\nhaving been on a steamer before, she was rather bewildered.\\n\\n“I’ll show you the way, my dear. I always get my things settled at\\nonce, as one never knows when one may have to turn in. The Professor\\nwill go with you, Ethel; it is not proper for you to roam about\\nalone;” and with that hint Mrs. Homer led the way below, privately\\nwondering how these young persons were going to get on together.\\n\\nJane swallowed her “heimweh” in silence, and bestirred herself so\\nwell that soon the stateroom looked very cosy with the wrappers laid\\nready, the hanging bags tacked up, and all made ship-shape for the\\nten days’ trip.\\n\\n“But where are YOUR comforts? You have given Ethel all the room, the\\nlower berth, and the best of everything,” said Mrs. Homer, popping\\nin her head to see how her quiet neighbor got on.\\n\\n“Oh, I live in my trunk; I didn’t bring half as many little luxuries\\nas Ethel did, so I don’t need as much room. I’m used to living in\\ncorners like a mouse, and I get on very well,” answered Jane,\\nlooking very like a mouse just then, as she peeped out of the upper\\nberth, with her gray gown, bright eyes, and quick nod of\\ncontentment.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, I’ve just one word of advice to give you. Don’t let\\nthat child tyrannize over you. She means well, but is wilful and\\nthoughtless, and it is NOT your duty to be made a slave of. Assert\\nyourself and she will obey and respect you, and you will help her a\\ngreat deal. I know all about it; I was a companion in my youth, and\\nhad a hard time of it till I revolted and took my proper place. Now\\nlet us go up and enjoy the fine air while we can.”\\n\\n“Thank you, I will remember;” and Jane offered the good lady her\\narm, with a feeling of gratitude for such friendliness, all being\\nnew and strange to her, and many doubts of her own fitness for the\\nposition lying heavy at her heart.\\n\\nBut soon all was forgotten as she sat on deck watching the islands,\\nlighthouses, ships, and shores glide by as she went swiftly out to\\nsea that bright June day. Here was the long-cherished desire of her\\nlife come to pass at last, and now the parting with mother and\\nsisters was over, nothing but pleasure remained, and a very earnest\\npurpose to improve this unexpected opportunity to the uttermost.\\nThe cares of life had begun early for little Jane, she being the\\neldest of the three girls, and her mother a widow. First came hard\\nstudy, then a timid beginning as nursery governess; and as year by\\nyear the teaching of others taught her, she ventured on till here\\nshe was companion to a fine young lady “going abroad,” where every\\nfacility for acquiring languages, studying history, seeing the best\\npictures, and enjoying good society would all be hers. No wonder the\\nquiet face under the modest gray hat beamed, as it turned wistfully\\ntoward the unknown world before her, and that her thoughts were so\\nfar away, she was quite unconscious of the kind eyes watching her,\\nas Mrs. Homer sat placidly knitting beside her.\\n\\n“I shall like the Mouse, I’m quite sure. Hope Lemuel will be as well\\nsatisfied. Ethel is charming when she chooses, but will need looking\\nafter, that’s plain,” thought the lady as she glanced down the deck\\nto where her husband stood talking with several gentlemen, while his\\ncharge was already making friends with the gay girls who were to be\\nher fellow-passengers.\\n\\n“Daisy Millers, I fear,” went on Mrs. Homer, who had a keen eye for\\ncharacter, and was as fond of studying the people about her as the\\nProfessor was of looking up dead statesmen, kings, and warriors. The\\nyoung ladies certainly bore some resemblance to the type of American\\ngirl which one never fails to meet in travelling. They were dressed\\nin the height of the fashion, pretty with the delicate evanescent\\nbeauty of too many of our girls, and all gifted with the loud\\nvoices, shrill laughter, and free-and-easy manners which so astonish\\ndecorous English matrons and maids. Ethel was evidently impressed\\nwith their style, as they had a man and maid at their beck and call,\\nand every sign of ostentatious wealth about them. A stout papa, a\\nthin mamma, evidently worn out with the cares of the past winter,\\nthree half-grown girls, and a lad of sixteen made up the party; and\\na very lively one it was, as the Professor soon found, for he\\npresently bowed himself away, and left Ethel to her new friends,\\nsince she smilingly refused to leave them.\\n\\n“Ought I to go to her?” asked Jenny, waking from her happy reverie\\nto a sudden sense of duty as the gentleman sat down beside her.\\n\\n“Oh dear, no, she is all right. Those are the Sibleys of New York.\\nHer father knows them, and she will find them a congenial refuge\\nwhen she tires of us quiet folk; and you too, perhaps?” added the\\nProfessor as he glanced at the girl.\\n\\n“I think not. I should not be welcome to them, nor are they the sort\\nof people I like. I shall be very happy with the ‘quiet folk,’ if\\nthey won’t let me be in the way,” answered Jenny, in the cheerful\\nvoice that reminded one of the chirp of a robin.\\n\\n“We won’t; we’ll toss you overboard as soon as you begin to scream\\nand bounce in that style,” he answered, laughing at the idea of this\\ndemure young person’s ever dreaming of such a thing. Jenny laughed\\nalso, and ran to pick up Mrs. Homer’s ball, as it set out for a roll\\ninto the lee-scuppers. As she brought it back she found the\\nProfessor examining the book she left behind her.\\n\\n“Like all young travellers you cling to your ‘Baedeker,’ I see, even\\nin the first excitement of the start. He is a useful fellow, but I\\nknow my Europe so well now, I don’t need him.”\\n\\n“I thought it would be wise to read up our route a little, then I\\nneedn’t ask questions. They must be very tiresome to people who know\\nall about it,” said Jenny, regarding him with an expression of deep\\nrespect for she considered him a sort of walking encyclopaedia of\\nuniversal knowledge.\\n\\nIt pleased the learned man, who was kindly as well as wise, and\\nloved to let his knowledge overflow into any thirsty mind, however\\nsmall the cup might be. He liked the intelligent face before him,\\nand a timid question or two set him off on his favorite hobby at a\\npleasant amble, with Jenny on the pillion behind, as it were. She\\nenjoyed it immensely, and was deep in French history, when the lunch\\ngong recalled her from Francis I. and his sister Margaret to chops\\nand English ale.\\n\\nEthel came prancing back to her own party, full of praises of the\\nSibleys, and the fun they meant to have together.\\n\\n“They are going to the Langham; so we shall be able to go about with\\nthem, and they know all the best shops, and some lords and ladies,\\nand expect to be in Paris when we are, and that will be a great help\\nwith our dresses and things.”\\n\\n“But we are not going to shop and have new dresses till we are on\\nour way home, you know. Now we haven’t time for such things, and\\ncan’t trouble the Homers with more trunks,” answered Jenny, as they\\nfollowed their elders to the table.\\n\\n“I shall buy what I like, and have ten trunks if it suits me. I’m\\nnot going to poke round over old books and ruins, and live in a\\ntravelling-dress all the time. You can do as you like; it’s\\ndifferent with me, and _I_ know what is proper.”\\n\\nWith which naughty speech Ethel took her seat first at the table,\\nand began to nod and smile at the Sibleys opposite. Jenny set her\\nlips and made no answer, but ate her lunch with what appetite she\\ncould, trying to forget her troubles in listening to the chat going\\non around her.\\n\\nAll that afternoon Ethel left her to herself, and enjoyed the more\\ncongenial society of the new acquaintances. Jenny was tired, and\\nglad to read and dream in the comfortable seat Mrs. Homer left her\\nwhen she went for her nap.\\n\\nBy sunset the sea grew rough and people began to vanish below. There\\nwere many empty places at dinner-time, and those who appeared seemed\\nto have lost their appetites suddenly. The Homers were good\\nsailors, but Jenny looked pale, and Ethel said her head ached,\\nthough both kept up bravely till nine o’clock, when the Sibleys\\nprecipitately retired after supper, and Ethel thought she might as\\nwell go to bed early to be ready for another pleasant day to-morrow.\\n\\nJenny had a bad night, but disturbed no one. Ethel slept soundly,\\nand sprang up in the morning, eager to be the first on deck. But a\\nsudden lurch sent her and her hair-brush into a corner: and when she\\nrose, everything in the stateroom seemed to be turning somersaults,\\nwhile a deathly faintness crept over her.\\n\\n“Oh, wake up, Jane! We are sinking! What is it? Help me, help me!”\\n and with a dismal wail Ethel tumbled into her berth in the first\\nanguish of seasickness.\\n\\nWe will draw the curtain for three days, during which rough weather\\nand general despair reigned. Mrs. Homer took care of the girls till\\nJenny was able to sit up and amuse Ethel; but the latter had a hard\\ntime of it, for a series of farewell lunches had left her in a bad\\nstate for a sea-voyage, and the poor girl could not lift her head\\nfor days. The new-made friends did not trouble themselves about her\\nafter a call of condolence, but faithful Jenny sat by her hour after\\nhour, reading and talking by day, singing her to sleep at night, and\\noften creeping from her bed on the sofa to light her little candle\\nand see that her charge was warmly covered and quite comfortable.\\nEthel was used to being petted, so she was not very grateful; but\\nshe felt the watchful care about her, and thought Jane almost as\\nhandy a person as a maid, and told her so.\\n\\nJenny thanked her and said nothing of her own discomforts; but Mrs.\\nHomer saw them, and wrote to Mrs. Amory that so far the companion\\nwas doing admirably and all that could be desired. A few days later\\nshe added more commendations to the journal-letters she kept for the\\nanxious mothers at home, and this serio-comical event was the cause\\nof her fresh praises.\\n\\nThe occupants of the deck staterooms were wakened in the middle of\\nthe night by a crash and a cry, and starting up found that the\\nengines were still, and something was evidently the matter\\nsomewhere. A momentary panic took place; ladies screamed, children\\ncried, and gentlemen in queer costumes burst out of their rooms,\\nexcitedly demanding, “What is the matter?”\\n\\nAs no lamps are allowed in the rooms at night, darkness added to the\\nalarm, and it was some time before the real state of the case was\\nknown. Mrs. Homer went at once to the frightened girls, and found\\nEthel clinging to Jenny, who was trying to find the life-preservers\\nlashed to the wall.\\n\\n“We’ve struck! Don’t leave me! Let us die together! Oh, why did I\\ncome? why did I come?” she wailed; while the other girl answered\\nwith a brave attempt at cheerfulness, as she put over Ethel’s head\\nthe only life-preserver she could find,--.\\n\\n“I will! I will! Be calm, dear! I guess there is no immediate\\ndanger. Hold fast to this while I try to find something warm for you\\nto put on.”\\n\\nIn a moment Jenny’s candle shone like a star of hope in the gloom,\\nand by the time the three had got into wrappers and shawls, a peal\\nof laughter from the Professor assured them that the danger could\\nnot be great. Other sounds of merriment, as well as Mrs. Sibley’s\\nvoice scolding violently, was heard; and presently Mr. Homer came to\\ntell them to be calm, for the stoppage was only to cool the engines,\\nand the noise was occasioned by Joe Sibley’s tumbling out of his\\nberth in a fit of nightmare caused by Welsh rarebits and poached\\neggs at eleven at night.\\n\\nMuch relieved, and a little ashamed now of their fright, every one\\nsubsided; but Ethel could not sleep, and clung to Jenny in an\\nhysterical state till a soft voice began to sing “Abide with me” so\\nsweetly that more than one agitated listener blessed the singer and\\nfell asleep before the comforting hymn ended.\\n\\nEthel was up next day, and lay on the Professor’s bearskin rug on\\ndeck, looking pale and interesting, while the Sibleys sat by her\\ntalking over the exciting event of the night, to poor Joe’s great\\ndisgust. Jenny crept to her usual corner and sat with a book on her\\nlap, quietly reviving in the fresh air till she was able to enjoy\\nthe pleasant chat of the Homers, who established themselves near by\\nand took care of her, learning each day to love and respect the\\nfaithful little soul who kept her worries to herself, and looked\\nbrightly forward no matter how black the sky might be.\\n\\nOnly one other incident of the voyage need be told; but as that\\nmarked a change in the relations between the two girls it is worth\\nrecording.\\n\\nAs she prepared for bed late one evening, Mrs. Homer heard Jenny say\\nin a tone never used before,--\\n\\n“My dear, I must say something to you or I shall not feel as if I\\nwere doing my duty. I promised your mother that you should keep\\nearly hours, as you are not very strong and excitement is bad for\\nyou. Now, you WON’T come to bed at ten, as I ask you to every night,\\nbut stay up playing cards or sitting on deck till nearly every one\\nbut the Sibleys is gone. Mrs. Homer waits for us, and is tired, and\\nit is very rude to keep her up. Will you PLEASE do as you ought, and\\nnot oblige me to say you must?”\\n\\nEthel was sleepy and cross, and answered pettishly, as she held out\\nher foot to have her boot unbuttoned,--for Jenny, anxious to please,\\nrefused no service asked of her,--\\n\\n“I shall do as I like, and you and Mrs. Homer needn’t trouble\\nyourselves about me. Mamma wished me to have a good time, and I\\nshall! There is no harm in staying up to enjoy the moonlight, and\\nsing and tell stories. Mrs. Sibley knows what is proper better than\\nyou do.”\\n\\n“I don’t think she does, for she goes to bed and leaves the girls to\\nflirt with those officers in a way that I know is NOT proper,”\\n answered Jenny, firmly. “I should be very sorry to hear them say of\\nyou as they did of the Sibley girls, ‘They are a wild lot, but great\\nfun.’”\\n\\n“Did they say that? How impertinent!” and Ethel bridled up like a\\nruffled chicken, for she was not out yet, and had not lost the\\nmodest instincts that so soon get blunted when a frivolous\\nfashionable life begins.\\n\\n“I heard them, and I know that the well-bred people on board do not\\nlike the Sibleys’ noisy ways and bad manners. Now, you, my dear, are\\nyoung and unused to this sort of life; so you cannot be too careful\\nwhat you say and do, and with whom you go.”\\n\\n“Good gracious! any one would think YOU were as wise as Solomon and\\nas old as the hills. YOU are young, and YOU haven’t travelled, and\\ndon’t know any more of the world than I do,--not so much of some\\nthings; so you needn’t preach.”\\n\\n“I’m not wise nor old, but I DO know more of the world than you, for\\nI began to take care of myself and earn my living at sixteen, and\\nfour years of hard work have taught me a great deal. I am to watch\\nover you, and I intend to do it faithfully, no matter what you say,\\nnor how hard you make it for me; because I promised, and I shall\\nkeep my word. We are not to trouble Mrs. Homer with our little\\nworries, but try to help each other and have a really good time. I\\nwill do anything for you that I can, but I shall NOT let you do\\nthings which I wouldn’t allow my own sisters to do, and if you\\nrefuse to mind me, I shall write to your mother and ask to go home.\\nMy conscience won’t let me take money and pleasure unless I earn\\nthem and do my duty.”\\n\\n“Well, upon my word!” cried Ethel, much impressed by such a decided\\nspeech from gentle Jane, and dismayed at the idea of being taken\\nhome in disgrace.\\n\\n“We won’t talk any more now, because we may get angry and say what\\nwe should be sorry for. I am sure you will see that I am right when\\nyou think it over quietly. So good-night, dear.”\\n\\n“Good-night,” was all the reply Ethel gave, and a long silence\\nfollowed.\\n\\nMrs. Homer could not help hearing as the staterooms were close\\ntogether, and the well-ventilated doors made all conversation\\nbeyond a whisper audible.\\n\\n“I didn’t think Jane had the spirit to talk like that. She has taken\\nmy hint and asserted herself, and I’m very glad, for Ethel must be\\nset right at once or we shall have no peace. She will respect and\\nobey Jane after this, or I shall be obliged to say MY word.”\\n\\nMrs. Homer was right, and before her first nap set in she heard a\\nmeek voice say,--\\n\\n“Are you asleep, Miss Bassett?”\\n\\n“No, dear.”\\n\\n“Then I want to say, I’ve thought it over. Please DON’T write to\\nmamma. I’ll be good. I’m sorry I was rude to you; do forgive--”\\n\\nThe sentence was not ended, for a sudden rustle, a little sob, and\\nseveral hearty kisses plainly told that Jenny had flown to pardon,\\ncomfort, and caress her naughty child, and that all was well.\\n\\nAfter that Ethel’s behavior was painfully decorous for the rest of\\nthe voyage, which, fortunately for her good resolutions, ended at\\nQueenstown, much to her regret. The Homers thought a glimpse at\\nIreland and Scotland would be good for the girls; and as the\\nProfessor had business in Edinburgh this was the better route for\\nall parties. But Ethel longed for London, and refused to see any\\nbeauty in the Lakes of Killarney, turned up her nose at\\njaunting-cars, and pronounced Dublin a stupid place.\\n\\nScotland suited her better, and she could not help enjoying the fine\\nscenery with such companions as the Homers; for the Professor knew\\nall about the relics and ruins, and his wife had a memory richly\\nstored with the legends, poetry, and romance which make dull facts\\nmemorable and history enchanting.\\n\\nBut Jenny’s quiet rapture was pleasant to behold. She had not\\nscorned Scott’s novels as old-fashioned, and she peopled the\\ncottages and castles with his heroes and heroines; she crooned\\nBurns’s sweet songs to herself as she visited his haunts, and went\\nabout in a happy sort of dream, with her head full of Highland Mary,\\nTam o’ Shanter, field-mice and daisies, or fought terrific battles\\nwith Fitz-James and Marmion, and tried if “the light harebell” would\\n“raise its head, elastic from her airy tread,” as it did from the\\nLady of the Lake’s famous foot.\\n\\nEthel told her she was “clean daft;” but Jenny said, “Let me enjoy\\nit while I can. I’ve dreamed of it so long I can hardly realize that\\nit has come, and I cannot lose a minute of it;” so she absorbed\\nScotch poetry and romance with the mist and the keen air from the\\nmoors, and bloomed like the bonnie heather which she loved to wear.\\n\\n“What shall we do this rainy day in this stupid place?” said Ethel,\\none morning when bad weather kept them from an excursion to Stirling\\nCastle.\\n\\n“Write our journals and read up for the visit; then we shall know\\nall about the castle, and need not tire people with our questions,”\\n answered Jenny, already established in a deep window-seat of their\\nparlor at the hotel with her books and portfolio.\\n\\n“I don’t keep a journal, and I hate to read guide-books; it’s much\\neasier to ask, though there is very little I care for about these\\nmouldy old places,” said Ethel with a yawn, as she looked out into\\nthe muddy street.\\n\\n“How can you say so? Don’t you care for poor Mary, and Prince\\nCharlie, and all the other sad and romantic memories that haunt the\\ncountry? Why, it seems as real to me as if it happened yesterday,\\nand I never can forget anything about the place or the people now.\\nReally, dear, I think you ought to take more interest and improve\\nthis fine chance. Just see how helpful and lovely Mrs. Homer is,\\nwith a quotation for every famous spot we see. It adds so much to\\nour pleasure, and makes her so interesting. I’m going to learn some\\nof the fine bits in this book of hers, and make them my own, since I\\ncannot buy the beautiful little set this Burns belongs to. Don’t you\\nwant to try it, and while away the dull day by hearing each other\\nrecite and talking over the beautiful places we have seen?”\\n\\n“No, thank you; no study for me. It is to be all play now. Why tire\\nmy wits with that Scotch stuff when Mrs. Homer is here to do it for\\nme?” and lazy Ethel turned to the papers on the table for amusement\\nmore to her taste.\\n\\n“But we shouldn’t think only of our own pleasure, you know. It is so\\nsweet to be able to teach, amuse, or help others in any way. I’m\\nglad to learn this new accomplishment, so that I may be to some one\\nby-and-by what dear Mrs. Homer is to us now, if I ever can. Didn’t\\nyou see how charmed those English people were at Holyrood when she\\nwas reciting those fine lines to us? The old gentleman bowed and\\nthanked her, and the handsome lady called her ‘a book of elegant\\nextracts.’ I thought it was such a pretty and pleasant thing that I\\ndescribed it all to mother and the girls.”\\n\\n“So it was; but did you know that the party was Lord Cumberland and\\nhis family? The guide told me afterward. I never guessed they were\\nanybody, in such plain tweed gowns and thick boots; did you?”\\n\\n“I knew they were ladies and gentlemen by their manners and\\nconversation; did you expect they would travel in coronets and\\nermine mantles?” laughed Jenny.\\n\\n“I’m not such a goose! But I’m glad we met them, because I can tell\\nthe Sibleys of it. They think so much of titles, and brag about Lady\\nWatts Barclay, whose husband is only a brewer knighted. I shall buy\\na plaid like the one the lord’s daughter wore, and wave it in the\\nfaces of those girls; they do put on SUCH airs because they have\\nbeen in Europe before.”\\n\\nJenny was soon absorbed in her books; so Ethel curled herself up in\\nthe window-seat with an illustrated London paper full of some royal\\nevent, and silence reigned for an hour. Neither had seen the\\nProfessor’s glasses rise like two full moons above his paper now and\\nthen to peep at them as they chatted at the other end of the room;\\nneither saw him smile as he made a memorandum in his note-book, nor\\nguessed how pleased he was at Jenny’s girlish admiration of his\\nplain but accomplished and excellent wife. It was one of the trifles\\nwhich went to form his opinion of the two lasses, and in time to\\nsuggest a plan which ended in great joy for one of them.\\n\\n“Now the real fun begins, and I shall be perfectly contented,” cried\\nEthel as they rolled through the London streets towards the dingy\\nLangham Hotel, where Americans love to congregate.\\n\\nJenny’s eyes were sparkling also, and she looked as if quite ready\\nfor the new scenes and excitements which the famous old city\\npromised them, though she had private doubts as to whether anything\\ncould be more delightful than Scotland.\\n\\nThe Sibleys were at the hotel; and the ladies of both parties at\\nonce began a round of shopping and sightseeing, while the gentlemen\\nwent about their more important affairs. Joe was detailed for escort\\nduty; and a fine time the poor lad had of it, trailing about with\\nseven ladies by day and packing them into two cabs at night for the\\ntheatres and concerts they insisted on trying to enjoy in spite of\\nheat and weariness.\\n\\nMrs. Homer and Jenny were soon tired of this “whirl of gayety,” as\\nthey called it, and planned more quiet excursions with some hours\\neach day for rest and the writing and reading which all wise\\ntourists make a part of their duty and pleasure. Ethel rebelled, and\\nmuch preferred the “rabble,” as Joe irreverently called his troop of\\nladies, never losing her delight in Regent Street shops, the parks\\nat the fashionable hour, and the evening shows in full blast\\neverywhere during the season. She left the sober party whenever she\\ncould escape, and with Mrs. Sibley as chaperone, frolicked about\\nwith the gay girls to her heart’s content. It troubled Jenny, and\\nmade her feel as if she were not doing her duty; but Mrs. Homer\\nconsoled her by the fact that a month was all they could give to\\nLondon, and soon the parties would separate, for the Sibleys were\\nbound for Paris, and the Professor for Switzerland and Germany,\\nthrough August and September.\\n\\nSo little Jane gave herself up to the pleasures she loved, and with\\nthe new friends, whose kindness she tried to repay by every small\\nservice in her power, spent happy days among the famous haunts they\\nknew so well, learning much and storing away all she saw and heard\\nfor future profit and pleasure. A few samples of the different ways\\nin which our young travellers improved their opportunities will\\nsufficiently illustrate this new version of the gay grasshopper and\\nthe thrifty ant.\\n\\nWhen they visited Westminster Abbey, Ethel was soon tired of tombs\\nand chapels, and declared that the startling tableau of the skeleton\\nDeath peeping out of the half-opened door of the tomb to throw his\\ndart at Mrs. Nightingale, and the ludicrous has-relief of some great\\nearl in full peer’s robes and coronet being borne to heaven in the\\narms of fat cherubs puffing under their load, were the only things\\nworth seeing.\\n\\nJenny sat spellbound in the Poets’ Corner, listening while Mrs.\\nHomer named the illustrious dead around them; followed the verger\\nfrom chapel to chapel with intelligent interest as he told the story\\nof each historical or royal tomb, and gave up Madam Tussaud’s\\nwax-work to spend several happy hours sketching the beautiful\\ncloisters in the Abbey to add to her collection of water-colors,\\ntaken as she went from place to place, to serve as studies for her\\npupils at home.\\n\\nAt the Tower she grew much excited over the tragic spots she visited\\nand the heroic tales she heard of the kings and queens, the noble\\nhearts and wise heads, that pined and perished there. Ethel “hated\\nhorrors,” she said, and cared only for the crown jewels, the faded\\neffigies in the armor gallery, and the queer Highlanders skirling on\\nthe bagpipes in the courtyard.\\n\\nAt Kew Jenny revelled in the rare flowers, and was stricken with\\namazement at the Victoria Regia, the royal water-lily, so large that\\na child could sit on one of its vast leaves as on a green island.\\nHer interest and delight so touched the heart of the crusty keeper\\nthat he gave her a nosegay of orchids, which excited the envy of\\nEthel and the Sibley girls, who were of the party, but had soon\\nwearied of plants and gone off to order tea in Flora’s Bower,--one\\nof the little cottages where visitors repose and refresh themselves\\nwith weak tea and Bath buns in such tiny rooms that they have to put\\ntheir wraps in the fireplace or out of the window while they feast.\\n\\nAt the few parties to which they went,--for the Homers’ friends were\\nof the grave, elderly sort,--Jenny sat in a corner taking notes of\\nthe gay scene, while Ethel yawned. But the Mouse got many a crumb of\\ngood conversation as she nestled close to Mrs. Homer, drinking in\\nthe wise and witty chat that went on between the friends who came to\\npay their respects to the Professor and his interesting wife. Each\\nnight Jenny had new and famous names to add to the list in her\\njournal, and the artless pages were rich in anecdotes, descriptions,\\nand comments on the day’s adventures.\\n\\nBut the gem of her London collection of experiences was found in a\\nmost unexpected way, and not only gave her great pleasure, but made\\nthe young gadabouts regard her with sudden respect as one come to\\nhonor.\\n\\n“Let me stay and wait upon you; I’d much rather than go to the\\nCrystal Palace, for I shouldn’t enjoy it at all with you lying here\\nin pain and alone,” said Jenny one lovely morning when the girls\\ncame down ready for the promised excursion, to find Mrs. Homer laid\\nup with a nervous headache.\\n\\n“No, dear, you can do nothing for me, thanks. Quiet is all I need,\\nand my only worry is that I am not able to write up my husband’s\\nnotes for him. I promised to have them ready last night, but was so\\ntired I could not do it,” answered Mrs. Homer, as Jenny leaned over\\nher full of affectionate anxiety.\\n\\n“Let me do them! I’d be so proud to help; and I can, for I did copy\\nsome one day, and he said it was well done. Please let me; I should\\nenjoy a quiet morning here much better than the noisy party we shall\\nhave, since the Sibleys are to go.”\\n\\nWith some reluctance the invalid consented; and when the rest were\\ngone with hasty regrets, Jenny fell to work so briskly that in an\\nhour or two the task was done. She was looking wistfully out of the\\nwindow wondering where she could go alone, since Mrs. Homer was\\nasleep and no one needed her, when the Professor came in to see how\\nhis wife was before he went to the British Museum to consult certain\\nfamous books and parchments.\\n\\nHe was much pleased to find his notes in order, and after a glance\\nat the sleeping lady, told Jenny she was to come with him for a\\nvisit to a place which SHE would enjoy, though most young people\\nthought it rather dull.\\n\\nAway they went; and being given in charge to a pleasant old man,\\nJenny roamed over the vast Museum where the wonders of the world are\\ncollected, enjoying every moment, till Mr. Homer called her away, as\\nhis day’s work was done. It was late now, but she never thought of\\ntime, and came smiling up from the Egyptian Hall ready for the lunch\\nthe Professor proposed. They were just going out when a gentleman\\nmet them, and recognizing the American stopped to greet him\\ncordially. Jenny’s heart beat when she was presented to Mr.\\nGladstone, and she listened with all her ears to the silvery\\nun-English voice, and stared with all her eyes at the weary yet wise\\nand friendly face of the famous man.\\n\\n“I’m so glad! I wanted to see him very much, and I feel so grand to\\nthink I’ve really had a bow and a smile all to myself from the\\nPremier of England,” said Jenny in a flutter of girlish delight when\\nthe brief interview was over.\\n\\n“You shall go to the House of Commons with me and hear him speak\\nsome day; then your cup will be full, since you have already seen\\nBrowning, heard Irving, taken tea with Jean Ingelow, and caught a\\nglimpse of the royal family,” said the Professor, enjoying her keen\\ninterest in people and places.\\n\\n“Oh, thanks! that will be splendid. I do love to see famous persons,\\nbecause it gives me a true picture of them, and adds to my desire to\\nknow more of them, and admire their virtues or shun their faults.”\\n\\n“Yes, that sort of mental picture-gallery is a good thing to have,\\nand we will add as many fine portraits as we can. Now you shall ride\\nin a Hansom, and see how you like that.”\\n\\nJenny was glad to do so, for ladies do not use these vehicles when\\nalone, and Ethel had put on great airs after a spin in one with Joe.\\nJenny was girl enough to like to have her little adventures to boast\\nof, and that day she was to have another which eclipsed all that her\\nyoung companions ever knew.\\n\\nA brisk drive, a cosy lunch at a famous chop-house where Johnson\\nhad drunk oceans of tea, was followed by a stroll in the Park; for\\nthe Professor liked his young comrade, and was grateful for the\\nwell-written notes which helped on his work.\\n\\nAs they leaned against the railing to watch the splendid equipages\\nroll by, one that seemed well known, though only conspicuous by its\\nquiet elegance, stopped near them, and the elder of the two ladies\\nin it bowed and beckoned to Professor Homer. He hastened forward to\\nbe kindly greeted and invited to drive along the Ladies’ Mile.\\nJenny’s breath was nearly taken away when she was presented to the\\nDuchess of S--, and found herself sitting in a luxurious carriage\\nopposite her Grace and her companion, with a white-wigged coachman\\nperched aloft and two powdered footmen erect behind. Secretly\\nrejoicing that she had made herself especially nice for her trip\\nwith the Professor, and remembering that young English girls are\\nexpected to efface themselves in the company of their elders, she\\nsat mute and modest, stealing shy glances from under her hat-brim at\\nthe great lady, who was talking in the simplest way with her guest\\nabout his work, in which, as a member of one of the historical\\nhouses of England, she took much interest. A few gracious words fell\\nto Jenny’s share before they were set down at the door of the hotel,\\nto the great admiration of the porter, who recognized the liveries\\nand spread the news.\\n\\n“This is a good sample of the way things go in Vanity Fair. We\\ntrudge away to our daily work afoot, we treat ourselves to a humble\\ncab through the mud, pause in the park to watch the rich and great,\\nget whisked into a ducal carriage, and come home in state, feeling\\nrather exalted, don’t we?” asked the Professor as they went\\nupstairs, and he observed the new air of dignity which Jane\\nunconsciously assumed as an obsequious waiter flew before to open\\nthe door.\\n\\n“I think we do,” answered honest Jane, laughing as she caught the\\ntwinkle of his eyes behind the spectacles. “I like splendor, and I\\nAM rather set up to think I’ve spoken to a live duchess; but I think\\nI like her beautiful old face and charming manners more than her\\nfine coach or great name. Why, she was much more simply dressed than\\nMrs. Sibley, and talked as pleasantly as if she did not feel a bit\\nabove us. Yet one couldn’t forget that she was noble, and lived in a\\nvery different world from ours.”\\n\\n“That is just it, my dear; she IS a noble woman in every sense of\\nthe word, and has a right to her title. Her ancestors were\\nkingmakers, and she is Lady-in-waiting to the Queen; yet she leads\\nthe charities of London, and is the friend of all who help the world\\nalong. I’m glad you have met her, and seen so good a sample of a\\ntrue aristocrat. We Americans affect to scorn titles, but too many\\nof us hanker for them in secret, and bow before very poor imitations\\nof the real thing. Don’t fill your journal with fine names, as some\\nmuch wiser folk do, but set down only the best, and remember, ‘All\\nthat glitters is not gold.’”\\n\\n“I will, sir.” And Jenny put away the little sermon side by side\\nwith the little adventure, saying nothing of either till Mrs. Homer\\nspoke of it, having heard the story from her husband.\\n\\n“How I wish I’d been there, instead of fagging round that great\\npalace full of rubbish! A real Duchess! Won’t the Sibleys stare? We\\nshall hear no more of Lady Watts Barclay after this, I guess, and\\nyou will be treated with great respect; see if you are not!” said\\nEthel, much impressed with her companion’s good fortune and eager to\\ntell it.\\n\\n“If things of that sort affect them, their respect is not worth\\nhaving,” answered Jane, quietly accepting the arm Ethel offered her\\nas they went to dinner,--a very unusual courtesy, the cause of which\\nshe understood and smiled at.\\n\\nEthel looked as if she felt the reproof, but said nothing, only set\\nan example of greater civility to her companion, which the other\\ngirls involuntarily followed, after they had heard of Jenny’s\\nexcursion with the Professor.\\n\\nThe change was very grateful to patient Jane, who had borne many\\nsmall slights in proud silence; but it was soon over, for the\\nparties separated, and our friends left the city far behind them, as\\nthey crossed the channel, and sailed up the Rhine to Schwalbach,\\nwhere Mrs. Homer was to try the steel springs for her rheumatism\\nwhile the Professor rested after his London labors.\\n\\nA charming journey, and several very happy weeks followed as the\\ngirls roamed about the Little Brunnen, gay with people from all\\nparts of Europe, come to try the famous mineral waters, and rest\\nunder the lindens.\\n\\nJenny found plenty to sketch here, and was busy all day booking\\npicturesque groups as they sat in the Allee Saal, doing pretty\\nwoodland bits as they strolled among the hills, carefully copying\\nthe arches and statues in St. Elizabeth’s Chapel, or the queer old\\nhouses in the Jews’ Quarter of the town. Even the pigs went into the\\nportfolio, with the little swineherd blowing his horn in the morning\\nto summon each lazy porker from its sty to join the troop that\\ntrotted away to eat acorns in the oak wood on the hill till sunset\\ncalled them home again.\\n\\nEthel’s chief amusement was buying trinkets at the booths near the\\nStahlbrunnen. A tempting display of pretty crystal, agate, and steel\\njewelry was there, with French bonbons, Swiss carvings, German\\nembroidery and lace-work, and most delectable little portfolios of\\nviews of fine scenery or illustrations of famous books. Ethel spent\\nmuch money here, and added so greatly to her store of souvenirs that\\na new trunk was needed to hold the brittle treasures she accumulated\\nin spite of the advice given her to wait till she reached Paris,\\nwhere all could be bought much cheaper and packed safely for\\ntransportation.\\n\\nJenny contented herself with a German book, Kaulbach’s Goethe\\nGallery, and a set of ornaments for each sister; the purple, pink,\\nand white crystals being cheap and pretty trinkets for young girls.\\nShe felt very rich with her generous salary to draw upon when she\\nliked; but having made a list of proper gifts, she resisted\\ntemptation and saved her money, remembering how much every penny was\\nneeded at home.\\n\\nDriving from the ruins of Hohenstein one lovely afternoon, the girls\\ngot out to walk up a long hill, and amused themselves gathering\\nflowers by the way. When they took their places again, Ethel had a\\ngreat bouquet of scarlet poppies, Jenny a nosegay of blue\\ncorn-flowers for Mrs. Homer, and a handful of green wheat for\\nherself.\\n\\n“You look as if you had been gleaning,” said the Professor, as he\\nwatched the girls begin to trim their rough straw hats with the gay\\ncoquelicots and the bearded ears.\\n\\n“I feel as if I were doing that every day, sir, and gathering in a\\ngreat harvest of pleasure, if nothing else,” answered Jenny, turning\\nher bright eyes full of gratitude from one kind face to the other.\\n\\n“My poppies are much prettier than that stiff stuff. Why didn’t you\\nget some?” asked Ethel, surveying her brilliant decoration with\\ngreat satisfaction.\\n\\n“They don’t last; but my wheat will, and only grow prettier as it\\nripens in my hat,” answered Jenny, contentedly settling the graceful\\nspires in the straw cord that bound the pointed crown.\\n\\n“Then the kernels will all drop out and leave the husks; that won’t\\nbe nice, I’m sure,” laughed Ethel.\\n\\n“Well, some hungry bird will pick them up and be glad of them. The\\nhusks will last a long time and remind me of this happy day; your\\npoppies are shedding their leaves already, and the odor is not\\npleasant. I like my honest breadmaking wheat better than your opium\\nflowers,” said Jenny, with her thoughtful smile, as she watched the\\nscarlet petals float away leaving the green seed-vessels bare.\\n\\n“Oh, I shall get some artificial ones at my little milliner’s, and\\nbe fine as long as I like; so you are welcome to your useful,\\nbristly old wheat,” said Ethel, rather nettled by the look that\\npassed between the elders.\\n\\nNothing more was said; but both girls remembered that little talk\\nlong afterward, for those two wayside nosegays served to point the\\nmoral of this little tale, if not to adorn it.\\n\\nWe have no space to tell all the pleasant wanderings of our\\ntravellers as they went from one interesting place to another, till\\nthey paused for a good rest at Geneva.\\n\\nHere Ethel quite lost her head among the glittering display of\\njewelry, and had to be watched lest she rashly spend her last penny.\\nThey were obliged almost forcibly to carry her out of the enchanting\\nshops; and no one felt safe till she was either on the lake, or\\ndriving to Chamouni, or asleep in her bed.\\n\\nJenny bought a watch, a very necessary thing for a teacher, and this\\nwas the best place to get a good one. It was chosen with care and\\nmuch serious consultation with the Professor; and Mrs. Homer added a\\nlittle chain and seal, finding Jenny about to content herself with a\\nblack cord.\\n\\n“It is only a return for many daughterly services, my dear; and my\\nhusband wishes me to offer these with thanks to the patient\\nsecretary who has often helped him so willingly,” she said, as she\\ncame to wake Jenny with a kiss on the morning of her twenty-first\\nbirthday.\\n\\nA set of little volumes like those she had admired was the second\\ngift, and Jenny was much touched to be so kindly remembered. Ethel\\ngave her some thread lace which she had longed to buy for her mother\\nat Brussels, but did not, finding it as costly as beautiful. It was\\na very happy day, though quietly spent sitting by the lake enjoying\\nthe well-chosen extracts from Shakspeare, Wordsworth, Byron, Burns,\\nScott, and other descriptive poets, and writing loving letters home,\\nproudly stamped with the little seal.\\n\\nAfter that, while Ethel haunted the brilliant shops, read novels in\\nthe hotel-garden, or listlessly followed the sight-seers, Jenny,\\nwith the help of her valuable little library, her industrious\\npencil, and her accomplished guides, laid up a store of precious\\nsouvenirs as they visited the celebrated spots that lie like a\\nnecklace of pearls around the lovely lake, with Mont Blanc as the\\nsplendid opal that fitly clasps the chain. Calvin and Geneva,\\nVoltaire and Ferney, De Stael and Coppet, Gibbon’s garden at\\nLausanne, Byron’s Prisoner at Chillon, Rousseau’s chestnut grove at\\nClarens, and all the legends, relics, and memories of Switzerland’s\\nheroes, romancers, poets, and philosophers, were carefully studied,\\nrecorded, and enjoyed; and when at last they steamed away toward\\nParis, Jenny felt as if her head and her heart and one little trunk\\nheld richer treasures than all the jewelry in Geneva.\\n\\nAt Lyons her second important purchase was made; for when they\\nvisited one of the great manufactories to execute several\\ncommissions given to Mrs. Homer, Jenny proudly bought a nice black\\nsilk for her mother. This, with the delicate lace, would make the\\ndear woman presentable for many a day, and the good girl beamed with\\nsatisfaction as she pictured the delight of all at home when this\\nsplendid gift appeared to adorn the dear parent-bird, who never\\ncared how shabby she was if her young were well feathered.\\n\\nIt was a trial to Jenny, when they reached Paris, to spend day after\\nday shopping, talking to dressmakers, and driving in the Bois to\\nwatch the elegant world on parade, when she longed to be living\\nthrough the French Revolution with Carlyle, copying the quaint\\nrelics at Hotel Cluny, or revelling in the treasures of the Louvre.\\n\\n“Why DO you want to study and poke all the time?” asked Ethel, as\\nthey followed Mrs. Homer and a French acquaintance round the Palais\\nRoyal one day with its brilliant shops, cafes, and crowds.\\n\\n“My dream is to be able to take a place as teacher of German and\\nhistory in a girl’s school next year. It is a fine chance, and I am\\npromised it if I am fitted; so I must work when I can to be ready.\\nThat is why I like Versailles better than Rue de Rivoli, and enjoy\\ntalking with Professor Homer about French kings and queens more than\\nI do buying mock diamonds and eating ices here,” answered Jenny,\\nlooking very tired of the glitter, noise, and dust of the gay place\\nwhen her heart was in the Conciergerie with poor Marie Antoinette,\\nor the Invalides, where lay the great Napoleon still guarded by his\\nfaithful Frenchmen.\\n\\n“What a dismal prospect! I should think you’d rather have a jolly\\ntime while you could, and trust to luck for a place by-and-by, if\\nyou must go on teaching,” said Ethel, stopping to admire a window\\nfull of distracting bonnets.\\n\\n“No; it is a charming prospect to me, for I love to teach, and I\\ncan’t leave anything to luck. God helps those who help themselves,\\nmother says, and I want to give the girls an easier time than I have\\nhad; so I shall get my tools ready, and fit myself to do good work\\nwhen the job comes to me,” answered Jenny, with such a decided air\\nthat the French lady glanced back at her, wondering if a quarrel was\\ngoing on between the demoiselles.\\n\\n“What do you mean by tools?” asked Ethel, turning from the gay\\nbonnets to a ravishing display of bonbons in the next window.\\n\\n“Professor Homer said one day that a well-stored mind was a\\ntool-chest with which one could carve one’s way. Now, my tools are\\nknowledge, memory, taste, the power of imparting what I know, good\\nmanners, sense, and--patience,” added Jenny, with a sigh, as she\\nthought of the weary years spent in teaching little children the\\nalphabet.\\n\\nEthel took the sigh to herself, well knowing that she had been a\\ntrial, especially of late, when she had insisted on Jane’s company\\nbecause her own French was so imperfect as to be nearly useless,\\nthough at home she had flattered herself that she knew a good deal.\\nHer own ignorance of many things had been unpleasantly impressed\\nupon her lately, for at Madame Dene’s Pension there were several\\nagreeable English and French ladies, and much interesting\\nconversation went on at the table, which Jenny heartily enjoyed,\\nthough she modestly said very little. But Ethel, longing to\\ndistinguish herself before the quiet English girls, tried to talk\\nand often made sad mistakes because her head was a jumble of new\\nnames and places, and her knowledge of all kinds very superficial.\\nOnly the day before she had said in a patronizing tone to a French\\nlady,--\\n\\n“Of course we remember our obligations to your Lamartine during our\\nRevolution, and the other brave Frenchmen who helped us.”\\n\\n“You mean Lafayette, dear,” whispered Jenny quickly, as the lady\\nsmiled and bowed bewildered by the queerly pronounced French, but\\ncatching the poet’s name.\\n\\n“I know what I mean; you needn’t trouble yourself to correct and\\ninterrupt me when I’m talking,” answered Ethel, in her pert way,\\nannoyed by a smile on the face of the girl opposite, and Jenny’s\\nblush at her rudeness and ingratitude. She regretted both when Jane\\nexplained the matter afterward, and wished that she had at once\\ncorrected what would then have passed as a slip of the tongue. Now\\nit was too late; but she kept quiet and gave Miss Cholmondeley no\\nmore chances to smile in that aggravatingly superior way, though it\\nwas very natural, as she was a highly educated girl.\\n\\nThinking of this, and many other mistakes of her own from which Jane\\ntried to save her, Ethel felt a real remorse, and walked silently\\non, wondering how she could reward this kind creature who had served\\nher so well and was so anxious to get on in her hard, humble way.\\nThe orders were all given now, the shopping nearly done, and\\nMademoiselle Campan, the elderly French lady who boarded at their\\nPension, was always ready to jaunt about and be useful; so why not\\ngive Jane a holiday, and let her grub and study for the little while\\nleft them in Paris? In a fortnight Uncle Sam was to pick up the\\ngirls and take them home, while the Homers went to Rome for the\\nwinter. It would be well to take Miss Bassett back in a good humor,\\nso that her report would please Mamma, and appease Papa if he were\\nangry at the amount of money spent by his extravagant little\\ndaughter. Ethel saw now, as one always does when it is too late to\\nrepair damages, many things left undone which she ought to have\\ndone, and regretted living for herself instead of putting more\\npleasure into the life of this good girl, whose future seemed so\\nuninviting to our young lady with her first season very near.\\n\\nIt was a kind plan, and gratified Jenny very much when it was\\nproposed and proved to her that no duty would be neglected if she\\nwent about with the Homers and left her charge to the excellent lady\\nwho enjoyed chiffons as much as Ethel did, and was glad to receive\\npretty gifts in return for her services.\\n\\nBut alas for Ethel’s good resolutions and Jenny’s well-earned\\nholiday! Both came to nothing, for Ethel fell ill from too much\\npastry, and had a sharp bilious attack which laid her up till the\\nuncle arrived.\\n\\nEvery one was very kind, and there was no danger; but the days were\\nlong, the invalid very fretful, and the nurse very tired, before the\\nsecond week brought convalescence and a general cheering and\\nclearing up took place. Uncle Sam was amusing himself very\\ncomfortably while he waited for his niece to be able to travel, and\\nthe girls were beginning to pack by degrees, for the accumulation of\\nEthel’s purchases made her share a serious task.\\n\\n“There! All are in now, and only the steamer trunk is left to pack\\nat the last moment,” said Jenny, folding her tired arms after a\\nprotracted struggle with half a dozen new gowns, and a perplexing\\nmedley of hats, boots, gloves, and perfumery. Two large trunks stood\\nin the ante-room ready to go; the third was now done, and nothing\\nremained but the small one and Jenny’s shabby portmanteau.\\n\\n“How nicely you have managed! I ought to have helped, only you\\nwouldn’t let me and I should have spoilt my wrapper. Come and rest\\nand help me sort out this rubbish,” said Ethel, who would have been\\ndressed and out if the arrival of a new peignoir had not kept her in\\nto enjoy the lovely pink and blue thing, all lace and ribbon and\\nFrench taste.\\n\\n“You will never get them into that box, dear,” answered Jenny,\\ngladly sitting down beside her on the sofa, which was strewn with\\ntrinkets of all sorts, more or less damaged by careless handling,\\nand the vicissitudes of a wandering trunk.\\n\\n“I don’t believe they are worth fussing over. I’m tired of them, and\\nthey look very mean and silly after seeing real jewels here. I’d\\nthrow them away if I hadn’t spent so much money on them,” said\\nEthel, turning over the tarnished filigree, mock pearl, and\\nimitation coral necklaces, bracelets, and brooches that were\\ntumbling out of the frail boxes in which they came.\\n\\n“They will look pretty to people at home who have not been seeing so\\nmany as we have. I’ll sew up the broken cases, and rub up the\\nsilver, and string the beads, and make all as good as new, and you\\nwill find plenty of girls at home glad to get them, I am sure,”\\n answered Jenny, rapidly bringing order out of chaos with those\\nskilful hands of hers.\\n\\nEthel leaned back and watched her silently for a few minutes. During\\nthis last week our young lady had been thinking a good deal, and was\\nconscious of a strong desire to tell Jane Bassett how much she loved\\nand thanked her for all her patient and faithful care during the six\\nmonths now nearly over. But she was proud, and humility was hard to\\nlearn; self-will was sweet, and to own one’s self in the wrong a\\nmost distasteful task. The penitent did not know how to begin, so\\nwaited for an opportunity, and presently it came.\\n\\n“Shall you be glad to get home, Jenny?” she asked in her most\\ncaressing tone, as she hung her prettiest locket round her friend’s\\nneck; for during this illness all formality and coolness had melted\\naway, and “Miss Bassett” was “Jenny dear” now.\\n\\n“I shall be very, very glad to see my precious people again, and\\ntell them all about my splendid holiday; but I can’t help wishing\\nthat we were to stay till spring, now that we are here, and I have\\nno teaching, and may never get such another chance. I’m afraid it\\nseems ungrateful when I’ve had so much; but to go back without\\nseeing Rome is a trial, I confess,” answered honest Jane, rubbing\\naway at a very dull paste bandeau.\\n\\n“So it is; but I don’t mind so much, because I shall come again\\nby-and-by, and I mean to be better prepared to enjoy things properly\\nthan I am now. I’ll really study this winter, and not be such a\\nfool. Jenny, I’ve a plan in my head. I wonder if you’d like it? I\\nshould immensely, and I’m going to propose it to Mamma the minute I\\nget home,” said Ethel, glad to seize this opening.\\n\\n“What is it, deary?”\\n\\n“Would you like to be my governess and teach me all you know,\\nquietly, at home this winter? I don’t want to begin school again\\njust for languages and a few finishing things, and I really think\\nyou would do more for me than any one else, because you know what I\\nneed, and are so patient with your bad, ungrateful, saucy girl.\\nCould you? would you come?” and Ethel put her arms round Jenny’s\\nneck with a little sob and a kiss that was far more precious to Jane\\nthan the famous diamond necklace of Marie Antoinette, which she had\\nbeen reading about.\\n\\n“I could and I would with all my heart, if you want me, darling! I\\nthink we know and love each other now, and can be happy and helpful\\ntogether, and I’ll come so gladly if your mother asks me,” answered\\nJenny, quick to understand what underlay this sudden tenderness, and\\nglad to accept the atonement offered her for many trials which she\\nwould never have told even to her own mother.\\n\\nEthel was her best self now, and her friend felt well rewarded for\\nthe past by this promise of real love and mutual help in the future.\\nSo they talked over the new plan in great spirits till Mrs. Homer\\ncame to bring them their share of a packet of home letters just\\narrived. She saw that something unusual was going on, but only\\nsmiled, nodded, and went away saying,--\\n\\n“I have good news in MY letters, and hope yours will make you\\nequally happy, girls.”\\n\\nSilence reigned for a time, as they sat reading busily; then a\\nsudden exclamation from Ethel seemed to produce a strange effect\\nupon Jenny, for with a cry of joy she sprang up and danced all over\\nthe room, waving her letter wildly as she cried out,--\\n\\n“I’m to go! I’m to go! I can’t believe it--but here it is! How\\nkind, how very kind, every one is to me!” and down she went upon her\\nown little bed to hide her face and laugh and cry till Ethel ran to\\nrejoice with her.\\n\\n“Oh, Jenny, I’m so glad! You deserve it, and it’s like Mrs. Homer to\\nmake all smooth before she said a word. Let me read what Mamma\\nwrites to you. Here’s my letter; see how sweetly she speaks of you,\\nand how grateful they are for all you’ve done for me.”\\n\\nThe letters changed hands; and sitting side by side in an\\naffectionate bunch, the girls read the happy news that granted the\\ncherished wish of one and gave the other real unselfish pleasure in\\nanother’s happiness.\\n\\nJane was to go to Rome with the Homers for the winter, and perhaps\\nto Greece in the spring. A year of delight lay before her, offered\\nin such a friendly way, and with such words of commendation, thanks,\\nand welcome, that the girl’s heart was full, and she felt that every\\nsmall sacrifice of feeling, every lonely hour, and distasteful duty\\nwas richly repaid by this rare opportunity to enjoy still further\\ndraughts of the wisdom, beauty, and poetry of the wonderful world\\nnow open to her.\\n\\nShe flew off presently to try to thank her good friends, and came\\nback dragging a light new trunk, in which she nearly buried her\\nsmall self as she excitedly explained its appearance, while rattling\\nout the trays and displaying its many conveniences.\\n\\n“That dear woman says I’m to send my presents home in the old one by\\nyou, and take this to fill up in Rome. Think of it! A lovely new\\nFrench trunk, and Rome full of pictures, statues, St. Peter’s, and\\nthe Colosseum. It takes my breath away and makes my head spin.”\\n\\n“So I see. It’s a capital box, but it won’t hold even St. Peter’s,\\ndear; so you’d better calm down and pack your treasures. I’ll help,”\\n cried Ethel, sweeping about in her gay gown, almost as wild as Jane,\\nwho was quite upset by this sudden delicious change in her\\nprospects.\\n\\nHow happily she laid away in the old trunk the few gifts she had\\nventured to buy, and those given her,--the glossy silk, the dainty\\nlace, the pretty crystals, the store of gloves, the flask of\\ncologne, the pictures and books, and last of all the sketches which\\nillustrated the journal kept so carefully for those at home.\\n\\n“Now, when my letter is written and the check with all that is left\\nof my salary put in, I am done. There’s room for more, and I wish\\nI’d got something else, now I feel so rich. But it is foolish to buy\\ngowns to pay duties on, when I don’t know what the girls need. I\\nfeel so rich now, I shall fly out and pick up some more little\\npretties for the dears. They have so few, anything will be charming\\nto them,” said Jenny, proudly surveying her box, and looking about\\nfor some foreign trifle with which to fill up the corners.\\n\\n“Then let me put these in, and so be rid of them. I shall go to see\\nyour people and tell them all about you, and explain how you came to\\nsend so much rubbish.”\\n\\nAs she spoke Ethel slipped in several Swiss carvings, the best of\\nthe trinkets, and a parcel of dainty Parisian ties and sashes which\\nwould gladden the hearts of the poor, pretty girls, just beginning\\nto need such aids to their modest toilets. A big box of bonbons\\ncompleted her contribution, and left but one empty corner.\\n\\n“I’ll tuck in my old hat to keep all steady; the girls will like it\\nwhen they dress up, and I’m fond of it, because it recalls some of\\nmy happiest days,” said Jenny, as she took up the well-worn hat and\\nbegan to dust it. A shower of grain dropped into her hand, for the\\nyellow wheat still kept its place and recalled the chat at\\nSchwalbach. Ethel glanced at her own hat with its faded artificial\\nflowers; and as her eye went from the small store of treasures so\\ncarefully and happily gathered to the strew of almost useless finery\\non her bed, she said soberly,--\\n\\n“You were right, Jenny. My poppies are worthless, and my harvest a\\nvery poor one. Your wheat fell in good ground, and you will glean a\\nwhole stack before you go home. Well, I shall keep MY old hat to\\nremind me of you: and when I come again, I hope I shall have a wiser\\nhead to put into a new one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITTLE BUTTON-ROSE\\n\\n\\n“If you please, I’ve come,” said a small girl, as she walked into a\\nlarge room where three ladies sat at work.\\n\\nOne of the ladies was very thin, one very stout, and the youngest\\nvery pretty. The eldest put on her glasses, the stout one dropped\\nher sewing, and the pretty one exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Why, it must be little Rosamond!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve come; the man is taking my trunk upstairs, and I’ve got a\\nletter for Cousin Penelope,” said the child, with the sweet\\ncomposure of one always sure of a welcome.\\n\\nThe stout lady held out her hand for the letter; but the little\\ngirl, after a keen look at the three faces, went to the old lady,\\nwho received her with a kiss, saying,--\\n\\n“That’s right; but how did you know, dear?”\\n\\n“Oh, Papa said Cousin Penny is old, Cousin Henny fat, and Cousin\\nCicely rather pretty; so I knew in one minute,” replied Rosamond, in\\na tone of innocent satisfaction at her own cleverness, and quite\\nunconscious of the effect of her speech.\\n\\nMiss Penelope hastily retired behind the letter. Miss Henrietta\\nfrowned so heavily that the gold-rimmed eye-glasses flew off her\\nnose with a clash, and Cicely laughed outright, as she exclaimed,--\\n\\n“I’m afraid we have got an enfant terrible among us, though I can’t\\ncomplain of my share of the compliments.”\\n\\n“I never expected to find Clara’s child well mannered, and I see I\\nwas quite right. Take your hat off, Rosamond, and sit down. It tires\\nSister to lean on her in that way,” said Miss Henny in a severe\\ntone, with no offer of any warmer welcome.\\n\\nSeeing that something was amiss, the child quietly obeyed, and\\nperching herself in an ancient arm-chair crossed her short legs,\\nfolded her plump hands over the diminutive travelling-bag she\\ncarried, and sat looking about the room with a pair of very large\\nblue eyes, quite unabashed, though rather pensive, as if the memory\\nof some tender parting were still fresh in her little heart.\\n\\nWhile Miss Penny slowly reads the letter, Miss Henny works daisies\\non a bit of canvas with pettish jerks of her silk, and Miss Cicely\\nleans in the sofa-corner, staring at the newcomer, we will briefly\\nintroduce our small heroine. Her father was cousin to the elder\\nladies, and being called suddenly across the water on business, took\\nhis wife with him, leaving the little girl to the care of these\\nrelatives, thinking her too young for so long a journey. Cicely, an\\norphan niece who lived with the old ladies, was to have the care of\\nRosy; and a summer in the quiet country town would do her good,\\nwhile change of scene would console her for this first separation\\nfrom her mother. How she fared remains to be seen; and we need only\\nadd that the child had been well trained, made the companion of a\\nsweet and tender woman, and was very anxious to please the parents\\nwhom she passionately loved, by keeping the promises she had made\\nthem, and being “as brave as Papa, as patient and kind as dear\\nMamma.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think of it, Missy?” asked Cicely, as the blue\\neyes came back to her, after roving round the spacious,\\nold-fashioned, and rather gloomy room.\\n\\n“It’s a pretty large, dark place for a little girl to be all alone\\nin;” and there was a suspicious quiver in the childish voice, as\\nRosy opened her bag to produce a very small handkerchief, evidently\\nfeeling that she might have sudden need of it if some one did not\\nspeak to her very soon.\\n\\n“We keep it dark on account of Sister’s eyes. When _I_ was a little\\ngirl, it wasn’t considered polite to say rude things about other\\npeople’s houses, especially if they were very handsome ones,” said\\nMiss Henny, with a stern glance over the eye-glasses at the young\\noffender, whose second remark was even more unfortunate than her\\nfirst.\\n\\n“I didn’t mean to be rude, but I MUST tell the truth. Little girls\\nlike bright places. I’m sorry about Cousin Penny’s eyes. I will read\\nto her; I do to Mamma, and she says it is very well for a child only\\neight years old.”\\n\\nThe gentle answer and the full eyes seemed to calm Miss Henny’s\\nwrath, for her size was her tender point, and the old house her\\nespecial pride; so she dropped the awe-inspiring glasses, and said\\nmore kindly,--\\n\\n“There is a nice little room ready for you upstairs, and a garden to\\nplay in. Cicely will hear you read every day, and I will teach you\\nto sew, for of course that MOST useful part of your education has\\nbeen neglected.”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, I sew my four patches every day, and make little wee\\nstitches, and I can hem Papa’s hank’chifs, and I was learning to\\ndarn his socks with a big needle when--when they went away.”\\n\\nRosy paused with a sudden choke; but too proud to break down, she\\nonly wiped two drops off her cheek with the long ends of her little\\ngray silk glove, set her lips, and remained mistress of herself,\\nprivately planning to cry all she liked when she was safely in the\\n“nice little room” promised her.\\n\\nCicely, though a lazy, selfish young lady, was touched by the\\nchild’s pathetic face, and said in a friendly tone, as she patted\\nthe couch where she lay,--\\n\\n“Come here, dear, and sit by me, and tell me what kind of a kitten\\nyou’d like best. I know of a sweet yellow one, and two grays. Our\\nTabby is too old to play with you; so you will want a kitty, I’m\\nsure.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, if I may!” and Rosy skipped to the new seat with a smile\\nwhich plainly proved that this sort of welcome was just what she\\nliked.\\n\\n“Now, Cicely, why will you put such an idea into Rosamond’s head\\nwhen you know we can’t have kittens round the house for Sister to\\nstumble over, not to mention the mischief the horrid things always\\ndo? Tabby is all the child needs, with her doll. Of course you have\\na doll?” and Miss Henny asked the question as solemnly as if she had\\nsaid, “Have you a soul?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I have nine in my trunk, and two little ones in my bag, and\\nMamma is going to send me a big, big one from London, as soon as she\\ngets there, to sleep with me and be my little comfort,” cried Rosy,\\nrapidly producing from her bag a tiny bride and groom, three\\nseed-cakes, a smelling-bottle, and a purse out of which fell a shower of\\nbright cents, also crumbs all over the immaculate carpet.\\n\\n“Mercy on us, what a mess! Pick it all up, child, and don’t unpack\\nany more in the parlor. One doll is quite enough for me,” said Miss\\nHenny, with a sigh of resignation as if asking patience to bear this\\nnew calamity.\\n\\nRosy echoed the sigh as she crept about reclaiming her precious\\npennies, and eating the crumbs as the only way of disposing of them.\\n\\n“Never mind, it’s only her way; the heat makes her a little cross,\\nyou see,” whispered Cicely, bending down to hold the bag, into which\\nRosy bundled her treasures in hot haste.\\n\\n“I thought fat people were always pleasant. I’m glad YOU ain’t fat,”\\n answered the little girl, in a tone which was perfectly audible.\\n\\nWhat would have happened I tremble to think, if Miss Penny had not\\nfinished the letter at that moment and handed it to her sister,\\nsaying as she held out her arms to the child,--\\n\\n“Now I know all about it, and you are to be my baby; so come and\\ngive me some sweet kisses, darling.”\\n\\nDown dropped the bag, and with a little sob of joy the child nestled\\nclose to the kind old heart that welcomed her so tenderly at last.\\n\\n“Papa calls me his button-rose, ‘cause I’m so small and pink and\\nsweet, and thorny too sometimes,” she said, looking up brightly,\\nafter a few moments of the fond and foolish cuddling all little\\ncreatures love and need so much when they leave the nest, and miss\\nthe brooding of motherly wings.\\n\\n“We’ll call you anything you like, darling; but Rosamond is a pretty\\nold name, and I’m fond of it, for it was your grandmamma’s, and a\\nsweeter woman never lived,” said Miss Penny, stroking the fresh\\ncheeks, where the tears shone like dew on pink rose-leaves.\\n\\n“I shall call you Chicken Little, because we have Henny and Penny;\\nand the girls and Tab downstairs can be Goosey-Loosey, Turkey-Lurkey,\\nand Cocky-Locky. I’ll be Ducky-Lucky, and I’m sure Foxy-Loxy lives\\nnext door,” said Cicely, laughing at her own wit, while Miss Henny\\nlooked up, saying, with the first smile Rosy had seen,--\\n\\n“That’s true enough! and I hope Chicken Little will keep out of his\\nway, no matter if the sky does fall.”\\n\\n“Who is it? A truly fox? I never saw one. Could I peep at him\\nsometimes?” cried the child, much interested at once.\\n\\n“No, dear; it’s only a neighbor of ours who has treated us badly, at\\nleast we think so, and we don’t speak, though we used to be good\\nfriends some years ago. It’s sad to live so, but we don’t quite see\\nhow to help it yet. We are ready to do our part; but Mr. Dover\\nshould take the first step, as he was in the wrong.”\\n\\n“Please tell about it. I have horrid quarrels with Mamie Parsons\\nsometimes, but we always kiss and make up, and feel all happy again.\\nCan’t you, Cousin Penny?” asked the child, softly touching the\\nlittle white curls under the lace cap.\\n\\n“Well, no, dear; grown people cannot settle differences in that\\npretty way. We must wait till he apologizes, and then we shall\\ngladly be friends again. You see Mr. Dover was a missionary in India\\nfor many years, and we were very intimate with his mother. Our\\ngardens join, and a gate in our fence led across their field to the\\nback street, and was most convenient when we wanted to walk by the\\nriver or send the maids on errands in a hurry. The old lady was very\\nneighborly, and we were quite comfortable till Thomas came home and\\nmade trouble. He’d lost his wife and children, poor man, and his\\nliver was out of order, and living among the heathen so long had\\nmade him melancholy and queer; so he tried to amuse himself with\\ngardening and keeping hens.”\\n\\n“I’m glad! I love flowers and biddies,” murmured Rosy, listening\\nwith deep interest to this delightful mixture of quarrels and\\nheathen, sorrow, poultry, mysterious diseases, and gardens.\\n\\n“He had no right to shut up our gate and forbid our crossing that\\nlittle field, and no GENTLEMAN would have DARED to do it after all\\nour kindness to his mother,” exclaimed Miss Henny, so suddenly and\\nviolently that Rosamond nearly fell off the old lady’s lap with the\\nstart she gave.\\n\\n“No, sister, I don’t agree there. Mr. Thomas had a perfect RIGHT to\\ndo as he liked with his own land; but I think we should have had no\\ntrouble if you had been willing to sell him the corner of our garden\\nwhere the old summer-house is, for his hens,” began Miss Penny in a\\nmild tone.\\n\\n“Sister! you know the tender memories connected with that bower, and\\nhow terrible it would have been to ME to see it torn down, and noisy\\nfowls clucking and pecking where I and my poor Calvin once sat\\ntogether,” cried Miss Henny, trying to look sentimental, which was\\nan impossible feat for a stout lady in a flowery muslin gown, and a\\nfly-away cap full of blue ribbons, on a head once flaxen and now\\ngray.\\n\\n“We won’t discuss the point, Henrietta,” said the elder lady with\\ndignity; whereupon the other returned to the letter, bridling and\\ntossing her head in a way which caused Rosy to stare, and resolve to\\nimitate it when she played being a proud princess with her dolls.\\n\\n“Well, dear, that was the beginning of the trouble,” continued Miss\\nPenny; “and now we don’t speak, and the old lady misses us, I’m\\nsure, and I often long to run in and see her, and I’m so sorry you\\ncan’t enjoy the wonders of that house, for it’s full of beautiful\\nand curious things, most instructive for children to observe. Mr.\\nThomas has been a great traveller, and has a tiger skin in the\\nparlor so natural it’s quite startling to behold; also spears, and\\nbows and arrows, and necklaces of shark’s teeth, from the Cannibal\\nIslands, and the loveliest stuffed birds, my dear, all over the\\nplace, and pretty shells and baskets, and ivory toys, and odd\\ndresses, and no end of wonderful treasures. Such a sad pity you\\ncan’t see them!” and Miss Penny looked quite distressed at the\\nchild’s loss.\\n\\n“Oh, but I guess I will see ‘em! Every one is good to me, and old\\ngentlemen like little girls. Papa says so, and HE always does what I\\nwant when I say ‘Please’ with my wheedulin smile, as he calls it,”\\n said Rosy, giving them a sample of the most engaging sort.\\n\\n“You funny little thing, do try it, and soften the heart of that\\ntiresome man! He has the finest roses in town and the most delicious\\nfruit, and we never get any, though he sends quantities everywhere\\nelse. Such a fuss over an old ear-wiggy arbor! It is perfectly\\nprovoking, when we might enjoy so much over there; and who knows\\nwhat might happen!”\\n\\nAs Cicely spoke, she smoothed her brown curls and glanced at the\\nmirror, quite conscious that a very pretty young lady of twenty was\\nwasting her sweetness in the great gloomy house, with two elderly\\nspinsters.\\n\\n“I’ll get some for you,” answered Rosy, with a nod of such calm\\nconviction of her own power, that Cicely laughed again, and proposed\\nthat she should go at once and view the battle-field.\\n\\n“Could I RUN in the garden? I’d love to, after riding so long,”\\n asked Rosy, eager to be off; for her active legs ached for exercise,\\nand the close, shady room oppressed her.\\n\\n“Yes, dear; but don’t get into mischief, or worry Tabby, or pick the\\nflowers. Of course you wouldn’t touch green fruit, or climb trees,\\nor soil your little frock. I’ll ring the bell for you to come in and\\nbe dressed for tea when it is time.”\\n\\nWith these directions and a kiss, Miss Penny, as Cicely did not\\nstir, let the child out at the back door of the long hall, and\\nwatched her walk demurely down the main path of the prim old garden,\\nwhere no child had played for years, and even the toads and fat\\nrobins behaved in the most decorous manner.\\n\\n“It’s pretty dull, but it’s better than the parlor with all the\\nstaring pictures,” said Rosy to herself, after a voyage of discovery\\nhad shown her the few charms of the place. The sight of a large\\nyellow cat reposing in the sun cheered her eyes at that moment, and\\nshe hastened to scrape acquaintance with the stately animal; for the\\nsnails were not social, and the toads stared even more fixedly at\\nher than the painted eyes of her respected ancestors.\\n\\nBut Tabby disliked children as much as her mistress, and after\\nsubmitting ungraciously to a few caresses from the eager little\\nhands, she rose and retired majestically to a safer perch on the top\\nof the high wall which enclosed the garden. Being too lazy to jump,\\nshe walked up the shelves of an old flower-stand moulding in a\\ncorner, and by so doing, gave Rosy a brilliant idea, which she at\\nonce put into action by following Tabby’s example. Up this new sort\\nof ladder she went, and peeped over the wall, delighted at this\\nunexpected chance to behold the enemy’s territory.\\n\\n“Oh, what a pretty place!” she cried, clasping her grubby little\\nhands with rapture, as the beauties of the forbidden land burst upon\\nher view.\\n\\nIt was indeed a paradise to a child’s eyes,--for flowers bloomed\\nalong the winding paths; ripening fruit lay rosy and tempting in the\\nbeds below; behind the wire walls that confined them clucked and\\nstrutted various sorts of poultry; cages of gay birds hung on the\\npiazza; and through the open windows of the house one caught\\nglimpses of curious curtains, bright weapons, and mysterious objects\\nin the rooms beyond.\\n\\nA gray-headed gentleman in a queer nankeen coat lay asleep on a\\nbamboo lounge under the great cherry-tree, with a purple silk\\nhandkerchief half over his face.\\n\\n“That’s the missionary man, I s’pose. He doesn’t look cross at all.\\nIf I could only get down there, I’d go and wake him with a softly\\nkiss, as I do Papa, and ask to see his pretty things.”\\n\\nBeing quite unconscious of fear, Rosy certainly would have carried\\nout her daring plan, had it been possible; but no way of descending\\non the other side appeared, so she sighed and sat gazing wistfully,\\ntill Cousin Henny appeared for a breath of fresh air, and ordered\\nher down at once.\\n\\n“Come and see if my balsam-seeds have started yet. I keep planting\\nthem, but they WON’T come up,” she said, pointing out a mound of\\nearth newly dug and watered.\\n\\nRosy obediently scrambled up, and was trying to decide whether some\\ngreen sprouts were chickweed or the dilatory balsams when a sudden\\nuproar in the next garden made her stop to listen, while Miss Henny\\nsaid in a tone of great satisfaction, as the cackle of hens arose,--\\n\\n“Some trouble with those horrid fowls of his. I detest them, crowing\\nin the night, and waking us at dawn with their noise. I wish some\\nthief would steal every one of them. Nobody has a right to annoy\\ntheir neighbors with troublesome pets.”\\n\\nBefore Rosy could describe the beauties of the white bantams or the\\nsize of the big golden cock, a loud voice cried,--\\n\\n“You rascal! I’ll hang you if I catch you here again. Go home\\nquicker than you came, and tell your mistress to teach you better\\nmanners, if she values your life.”\\n\\n“It’s that man! Such language! I wonder who he’s caught? That bad\\nboy who steals our plums, perhaps.”\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of Miss Henny’s mouth when her question\\nwas answered in a sudden and dreadful way; for over the wall, hurled\\nby a strong arm, flew Tabby, high in the air, to fall with a thump\\ndirectly in the middle of the bed where they stood. Miss Henny\\nuttered a shrill scream, caught up her stunned treasure, and rushed\\ninto the house as fast as her size and flounces permitted, leaving\\nRosy breathless with surprise and indignation.\\n\\nBurning to resent this terrible outrage, she climbed quickly up the\\nsteps, and astonished the irate old gentleman on the other side by\\nthe sudden apparition of a golden head, a red childish face, and a\\ndirty little finger pointed sternly at him, as this small avenging\\nangel demanded,--\\n\\n“Missionary man, how COULD you kill my cousin’s cat?”\\n\\n“Bless my soul! who are you?” said the old gentleman, staring at\\nthis unexpected actor on the field of battle.\\n\\n“I’m Button-Rose, and I hate cruel people! Tabby’s dead, and now\\nthere isn’t any one to play with over here.”\\n\\nThis sad prospect made the blue eyes fill with sudden tears; and the\\napplication of the dirty fingers added streaks of mud to the red\\ncheeks, which much damaged the appearance of the angel, thought it\\nadded pathos to the child’s reproach.\\n\\n“Cats have nine lives, and Tabby’s used to being chucked over the\\nwall. I’ve done it several times, and it seems to agree with her,\\nfor she comes back to kill my chicks as bold as brass. See that!”\\n and the old gentleman held up a downy dead chicken, as proof of\\nTabby’s sin.\\n\\n“Poor little chicky!” groaned Rosy, yearning to mourn over the dear\\ndeparted and bury it with tender care. “It WAS very naughty of Tab;\\nbut, sir, you know cats are made to catch things, and they can’t\\nhelp it.”\\n\\n“They will have to help it, or I’ll drown the lot. This is a rare\\nbreed, and I’ve but two left after all my trouble, thanks to that\\nrascal of yours! What are you going to do about it?” demanded Mr.\\nDover, in a tone that made Rosy feel as if she had committed the\\nmurder herself.\\n\\n“I’ll talk to Tabby and try to make her good, and I’ll shut her up\\nin the old rabbit-house over here; then I hope she will be sorry and\\nnever do it any more,” she said, in such a remorseful tone that the\\nold gentleman relented at once, ashamed to afflict such a tender\\nlittle soul.\\n\\n“Try it,” he said, with a smile that made his yellow face pleasant\\nall at once. Then, as if ready to change the subject, he asked,\\nlooking curiously at the little figure perched on the wall,--\\n\\n“Where did you come from? Never saw any children over there before.\\nThey don’t allow ‘em.”\\n\\nRosy introduced herself in a few words, and seeing that her new\\nacquaintance seemed interested, she added with the wheedling smile\\nPapa found so engaging,--\\n\\n“It’s pretty lonely here, I guess; so p’r’aps you’ll let me peep at\\nyour nice garden sometimes if it doesn’t trouble you, sir?”\\n\\n“Poor little soul! it must be desperately dull with those three\\ntabbies,” he said to himself, as he stroked the dead chicken in his\\nhand, and watched the little face bent toward him.\\n\\n“Peep as much as you like, child; or, better still, come over and\\nrun about. _I_ like little girls,” he added aloud, with a nod and a\\nwave of welcome.\\n\\n“I told ‘em I was sure you did! I’d love to come, but they wouldn’t\\nlet me, I know. I’m so sorry about the fight. Couldn’t you make it\\nup, and be pleasant again?” asked Rosy, clasping her hands with a\\nbeseeching gesture as her bright face grew sad and serious\\nremembering the feud.\\n\\n“So they’ve told you that nonsense already, have they? Nice\\nneighbors THEY are,” said the old gentleman, frowning as if ill\\npleased at the news.\\n\\n“I’m glad I know; p’r’aps I can be a peace-maker. Mamma says they\\nare good to have in families, and I’d like to be one if I could.\\nWould you mind if I tried to peace-make a little, so I could come\\nover? I do want to see the red birds and the tiger skin awfully, if\\nyou please.”\\n\\n“What do you know about ‘em?” asked the old gentleman, sitting down\\non a garden chair, as if he didn’t mind continuing the chat with\\nthis new neighbor.\\n\\nNearly tumbling off the wall in her earnestness, Rosy repeated all\\nthat Cousin Penny had said; and something in the reasonable words,\\nthe flattering description of his treasures, and the sincere regret\\nof the old lady seemed to have a good effect upon Mr. Dover, for\\nwhen Rosy paused out of breath, he said in such an altered tone that\\nit was evident the peacemaking had already begun,--\\n\\n“Miss Carey is a gentlewoman! I always thought so. You tell her,\\nwith my compliments, that I’d be glad to see you any time if she has\\nno objection. I’ll put my step-ladder there, and you can come over\\ninstead of the cat. But mind you don’t meddle, or I might give you a\\ntoss like Tabby.”\\n\\n“I’m not afraid,” laughed Rosy. “I’ll go and ask right away, and I\\nwon’t touch a thing, and I know you’ll like me for a friend. Papa\\nsays I’m a dear little one. Thank you very much, sir. Good-by till I\\ncome again;” and with a kiss of the hand, the yellow head sunk out\\nof sight like the sun going down, leaving a sense of darkness behind\\nwhen the beaming little face disappeared, though fresh stains of\\ngreen mould from the wall made it rather like the tattooed\\ncountenances Mr. Dover used to see among his cannibal friends in\\nAfrica.\\n\\nHe sat musing with the dead chicken in his hand, forgetful of time,\\ntill a ring of his own door-bell called him in to receive a note\\nfrom Miss Penelope, thanking him for his invitation to little\\nRosamond, but declining it in the most polite and formal words.\\n\\n“I expected it! Bless the silly old souls! why can’t they be\\nreasonable, and accept the olive branch when I offer it? I’ll be\\nhanged if I do again! The fat one is at the bottom of this. Miss Pen\\nwould give in if that absurd Henrietta didn’t hold her back. Well,\\nI’m sorry for the child, but that’s not my fault;” and throwing down\\nthe note, he went out to water his roses.\\n\\nFor a week or two, Button-Rose hardly dared glance toward the\\nforbidden spot from her window, as she was ordered to play in the\\nfront garden, and sent to take sober walks with Cicely, who loved to\\nstop and gossip with her friends, while the poor child waited\\npatiently till the long tales were told.\\n\\nNursing Tabby was her chief consolation; and so kind was she, that\\nthe heart of the old cat softened to her, and she actually purred\\nher thanks at last, for all the saucers of cream, bits of chicken,\\nsoft pats, and tender words bestowed upon her by the little girl.\\n\\n“Well, I declare! Tab won’t do that even for me,” said Miss Henny,\\none day when she came upon the child sitting alone in the hall with\\na picture-book and the cat comfortably asleep in her lap.\\n\\n“Ammals always love me, if people don’t,” answered Button-Rose,\\nsoberly; for she had not yet forgiven the stout lady for denying her\\nthe delights offered by the “missionary man.”\\n\\n“That’s because AN-I-MALS can’t see how naughty you are sometimes,”\\n said Miss Henny tartly, not having recovered her temper even after\\nmany days.\\n\\n“I shall make EVERY one love me before I go away. Mamma told me to,\\nand I shall. I know how;” and Button smiled with a wise little nod\\nthat was pretty to see, as she proudly cuddled her first conquest.\\n\\n“We shall see;” and Miss Henny ponderously departed, wondering what\\nodd fancy the little thing would take into her head next.\\n\\nIt was soon evident; for when she came down from her long nap, later\\nin the afternoon, Miss Henny found Rosamond reading aloud to her\\nsister in the great dim parlor. They made a curious contrast,--the\\npale, white-haired, feeble old lady, with her prim dress, high cap,\\nknitting, and shaded eyes; and the child, rosy and round, quaint and\\nsweet, a pretty little ornament for the old-fashioned room, as she\\nsat among the tea-poys and samplers, ancient china and furniture,\\nwith the portraits of great grandfathers and grandmothers simpering\\nand staring at her, as if pleased and surprised to see such a\\ncharming little descendant among them.\\n\\n“Bless the baby! what is she at now?” asked Miss Henny, feeling more\\namiable after her sleep.\\n\\n“I’m reading to Cousin Penny, ‘cause no one else does, and her poor\\neyes hurt her, and she likes stories, and so do I,” answered Button,\\nwith one chubby finger on the place in her book, and eyes full of\\npride at the grown-up employment she had found for herself.\\n\\n“So kind of the little dear! She found me alone and wanted to amuse\\nme; so I proposed a story to suit us both, and she does very well\\nwith a little help now and then. I haven’t read ‘Simple Susan’ for\\nyears, and really enjoy it. Maria Edgeworth was always a favorite of\\nmine, and I still think her far superior to any modern writer for\\nthe young,” said Miss Penny, looking quite animated and happy in the\\nnew entertainment provided for her.\\n\\n“Go on, child; let me hear how well you can read;” and Miss Henny\\nsettled herself in the sofa-corner with her embroidery.\\n\\nSo Button started bravely on, and tried so hard that she was soon\\nout of breath. As she paused, she said with a gasp,--\\n\\n“Isn’t Susan a dear girl? She gives ALL the best things to other\\npeople, and is kind to the old harper. She didn’t send him away, as\\nyou did the music-man to-day, and tell him to be still.”\\n\\n“Organs are a nuisance, and I never allow them here. Go on, and\\ndon’t criticise your elders, Rosamond.”\\n\\n“Mamma and I always talk over stories, and pick out the morals of\\n‘em. SHE likes it;” with which remark, made sweetly not pertly,\\nButton went on to the end, with an occasional lift over a long word;\\nand the old ladies were interested, in spite of themselves, in the\\nsimple tale read in that childish voice.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear, it is very nice, and we will have one every day.\\nNow, what can I do for you?” asked Miss Penny, as the little girl\\npushed the curls off her forehead, with a sigh of mingled weariness\\nand satisfaction.\\n\\n“Let me go in the back garden and peep through the knot-hole at the\\npretty roses. I do long to see if the moss ones are out, and the\\ncherries ripe,” said Rosy, clasping her hands imploringly.\\n\\n“It can do no harm, Henrietta. Yes, dear, run away and get some\\ncatnip for Tabby, and see if the balsams are up yet.”\\n\\nThat last suggestion won Miss Henny’s consent; and Button was off at\\nonce, skipping like a young colt all over the garden, which now\\nseemed delightful to her.\\n\\nAt the back of the summer-house was a narrow space between it and\\nthe fence where certain plump toads lived; peeping in to watch them,\\nRosy had spied a large knot-hole in the old boards, and through it\\nfound she could get a fine view of several rose-bushes, a tree, and\\none window of the “missionary man’s” house. She had longed for\\nanother peep since the flower-stand was gone, and climbing trees\\nforbidden; now with joy she slipped into the damp nook, regardless\\nof the speckled gentlemen who stared at her with dismay, and took a\\ngood look at the forbidden paradise beyond.\\n\\nYes, the “moss ones” were in bloom, the cherries quite red, and at\\nthe window was the gray head of Mr. Dover, as he sat reading in his\\nqueer yellow dressing-gown.\\n\\nButton yearned to get in, and leaned so hard against the hateful\\nfence that the rotten board cracked, a long bit fell out, and she\\nnearly went after it, as it dropped upon the green bank below. Now\\nthe full splendor of the roses burst upon her, and a delightful\\ngooseberry bush stood close by with purplish berries temptingly\\nbobbing within reach. This obliging bush hid the hole, but left fine\\nopenings to see through; so the child popped her curly head out, and\\ngazed delightedly at the chickens, the flowers, the fruit, and the\\nunconscious old gentleman not far away.\\n\\n“I’ll have it for my secret; or maybe I’ll tell Cousin Penny, and\\nbeg her to let me peep if I truly promise never to go in,” thought\\nButton, knowing well who her best friend was.\\n\\nAt bedtime, when the dear old lady came to give the good-night kiss,\\nwhich the others forgot, Rosy, as Miss Penny called her, made her\\nrequest; and it was granted, for Miss Penny had a feeling that the\\nlittle peacemaker would sooner or later heal the breach with her\\npretty magic, and so she was very ready to lend a hand in a quiet\\nway.\\n\\nNext day at play-time, Button was hurrying down her last bit of\\ngingerbread, which she was obliged to eat properly in the\\ndining-room, instead of enjoying out-of-doors, when she heard a\\nsudden flurry in the garden, and running to the window saw Roxy the\\nmaid chasing a chicken to and fro, while Miss Henny stood flapping\\nher skirts on the steps, and crying, “Shoo!” till she was red in the\\nface.\\n\\n“It’s the white banty, and it must have come in my hole! Oh dear, I\\nhope they won’t catch it! Cousin Henny said she’d wring the neck of\\nthe first one that flied over the wall.”\\n\\nAway went Rosy, to join in the hunt; for Miss Henny was too fat to\\nrun, and Roxy found the lively fowl too much for her. It was a long\\nand hard chase; feathers flew, the maid lost her breath, Rosy\\ntumbled down, and Miss Henny screamed and scolded till she was\\nforced to sit down and watch in silence.\\n\\nAt last poor, hunted Banty ran into the arbor, for its clipped wings\\nwould not lift it over the wall. Button rushed after it, and dismal\\nsqualls plainly proclaimed that the naughty chicken was caught.\\n\\nMiss Henny waddled down the path, declaring that she WOULD wring its\\nneck; and Roxy went puffing after her, glad to rest. But the old\\nsummer-house was empty. No little girl, no ruffled bantam, appeared.\\nBoth had vanished like magic; and mistress and maid stared at each\\nother in amazement, till they saw that the long-disused window was\\nopen, and a gleam of light came in from the narrow opening behind.\\n\\n“My patience! if that child hasn’t crept out there, and bolted\\nthrough that hole in the fence! Did you ever, Miss?” exclaimed Roxy,\\ntrying not to look pleased at being spared the distasteful task of\\nkilling the poor chicken.\\n\\n“Naughty girl!” began Miss Henny, when the sound of voices made both\\nlisten. “Slip in there, and see what is going on,” said the\\nmistress, well knowing that her stout person never could be squeezed\\ninto the small space between house and fence.\\n\\nRoxy, being thin, easily obeyed, and in a whisper telephoned what\\nwent on beyond the hole, causing Miss Henny much vexation, surprise,\\nand at last real pleasure, as the child performed her little part in\\nthe mission she had undertaken.\\n\\n“Oh, please, it’s all my fault! I kept the hole open, Mr. Thomas,\\nand so Banty flied in. But it isn’t hurt a bit, and I’ve brought it\\nhome all safe, ‘cause I know you love your chickies, and Tabby ate\\nlots of ‘em,” said the childish voice in its most conciliatory tone.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you fling it over the wall, as I did the cat?” asked Mr.\\nDover, smiling, as he shut up the truant fowl, and turned to look at\\nthe rosy, breathless child, whose pink frock bore the marks of many\\na tumble on grass and gravel.\\n\\n“It would hurt Banty’s feelings, and yours too, and not be polite.\\nSo I came myself, to make some pollygies, and say it was my fault.\\nBut, please, could I keep the hole to peep through, if I always put\\nup a board when I go away? It is so dull in there, and SO sweet in\\nhere!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think a little gate would be nicer,--one just big enough\\nfor you, with a hook to fasten it? We’ll call it a button-hole,”\\n laughed Mr. Dover. “Then you could peep; or perhaps the ladies will\\nthink better of it, and show that they pardon my ill treatment of\\nTabby by letting you come in and pick some cherries and roses now\\nand then.”\\n\\nThis charming proposal caused the little girl to clasp her hands and\\ncry aloud,--\\n\\n“That would be perfully sp’endid! I know Cousin Penny would like it,\\nand let me. P’r’aps she’d come herself; she’s so thin, she could,\\nand she loves your mother and wants to see her. Only, Cousin Henny\\nwon’t let us be nice and friendly. S’pose you send HER some\\ncherries; she loves good things to eat, and maybe she will say yes,\\nif you send lots.”\\n\\nMr. Dover laughed at this artless proposal, and Miss Henny smiled at\\nthe prospect of a gift of the luscious black-heart cherries she had\\nbeen longing for. Roxy wisely repeated only the agreeable parts of\\nthe conversation; so nothing ruffled the lady’s temper. Now, whether\\nMr. Dover’s sharp eye caught a glimpse of the face among the\\ngooseberry bushes, and suspected eavesdroppers, or whether the\\nchild’s earnest desire to make peace touched him, who shall say?\\nCertain it is that his eyes twinkled like a boy’s, as he said rather\\nloudly, in his most affable tone,--\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to send Miss Henrietta a basket of fruit. She\\nused to be a charming young woman. It’s a pity she shuts herself up\\nso much; but that sad little romance of hers has darkened her life,\\nI suppose. Ah, well, I can sympathize with her!”\\n\\nRosy stared at the sudden change in his manner, and was rather\\nbewildered by his grown-up way of talking to her. But being intent\\non securing something nice to carry home, she stuck to the cherries,\\nwhich she DID understand, and pointing to the piazza said with a\\nbusiness-like air,--\\n\\n“There’s a basket; so we might pick ‘em right away. I love to go up\\nin trees and throw ‘em down; and I know Cousin Henny will like\\ncherries ever so much, and not scold a bit when I take some to her.”\\n\\n“Then come on,” cried Mr. Thomas, relapsing into the hearty manner\\nshe liked so much; and away he went, quite briskly, down the path,\\nwith his yellow skirts waving in the wind, and Button skipping after\\nhim in great glee.\\n\\n“They actually ARE a-picking cherries, Miss, up in the tree like a\\ncouple of robins a-chirpin’ and laughin’ as gay as can be,” reported\\nRoxy, from her peep-hole.\\n\\n“Rip off the rest of that board, then I can see,” whispered Miss\\nHenny, quivering with interest now; for she had heard Mr. Dover’s\\nwords, and her wrath was appeased by that flattering allusion to\\nherself.\\n\\nOff came the rest of the board, and from the window, half hidden in\\nwoodbine, she could now see over the bushes into the next garden.\\nThe peep-hole commanded the tree, and she watched with eager eyes\\nthe filling of the basket to be sent her, planning the while a\\ncharming note of thanks.\\n\\n“Do look, Miss; they are resting now, and she’s on his knee. Ain’t\\nit a pretty picter?” whispered Roxy, unmindful of the earwigs, ants,\\nand daddy-long-legs promenading over her as she crouched in her\\nmouldy corner, intent on the view beyond.\\n\\n“Very pretty! He lost several children in India and I suppose Rosy\\nreminds him of them. Ah, poor man! I can sympathize with him, for\\n_I_ too have loved and lost,” sighed Miss Henny, pensively surveying\\nthe group on the rustic seat.\\n\\nThey were playing cherry-bob; and the child’s laughter made pleasant\\nmusic in the usually quiet place, while the man’s face lost its sad,\\nstern look, and was both gay and tender, as he held the little\\ncreature close, and popped the ripe fruit into the red, laughing\\nmouth.\\n\\nAs the last sweet morsel disappeared Rosy said, with a long breath\\nof perfect content,--\\n\\n“It’s ALMOST as good as having Papa to play with. I do hope the\\ncousins WILL let me come again! If they don’t, I think my heart will\\nbreak, ‘cause I get so homesick over there, and have so many trials,\\nand no one but Cousin Penny ever cuddles me.”\\n\\n“Bless her heart! We’ll send her some flowers for that. You tell her\\nthat Mrs. Dover is poorly, and would like very much to see her; and\\nso would Mr. Thomas, who enjoys her little niece immensely. Can you\\nremember that?”\\n\\n“Every word! SHE is very nice to me, and I love her, and I guess she\\nwill be glad to come. She likes MOSS-roses, and so do I,” added the\\nunblushing little beggar, as Mr. Dover took out his knife and began\\nto make the bouquet which was to be Miss Penny’s bribe. He could not\\nbear to give up his little playmate, and was quite ready to try\\nagain, with this persistent and charming ally to help him heal the\\nbreach.\\n\\n“Shall you send anything to Cis? You needn’t mind about it, ‘cause\\nshe can’t keep me at home, but it might please her, and make her\\nstop rapping my head with her thimble when I ask questions, and\\nslapping my fingers when I touch any of her pretty things,”\\n suggested Button, as the flowers were added to the fruit, making\\na fine display.\\n\\n“I never send presents to YOUNG ladies,” said Mr. Thomas shortly,\\nadding, with both hands out, and his most inviting smile, “But I\\nALWAYS kiss nice little girls if they will allow me?”\\n\\nButton threw both arms about his neck and gave him a shower of\\ngrateful kisses, which were sweeter to the lonely old man than all\\nthe cherries that ever grew, or the finest flowers in his garden.\\nThen Miss Rosamond proudly marched home, finding no trace of the\\nwatchers, for both had fled while the “cuddling” went on. Roxy was\\nsoberly setting the dinner-table, and Miss Henny in the parlor\\nbreathing hard behind a newspaper. Miss Penny and Cicely were\\nspending the day out, so the roses had to wait; but the basket was\\nmost graciously received, also the carefully delivered message, and\\nthe child’s heart was rejoiced by free permission to go and see “our\\nkind neighbor now and then, if Sister does not object.”\\n\\nRosy was in great spirits, and prattled away as they sat at dinner,\\nemboldened by the lady’s unusual amiability to ask all sorts of\\nquestions, some of which proved rather embarrassing to Miss Henny,\\nand very amusing to Roxy, listening in the china-closet.\\n\\n“I wish _I_ had ‘spepsia,” was the abrupt remark of the small person\\nas her plate of drum-sticks was removed and the pudding appeared,\\naccompanied by the cherries.\\n\\n“Why, dear?” asked Miss Henny, busily arranging the small dish of\\ndelicate tidbits, which left little but the skeleton of the roast\\nfowl for the kitchen.\\n\\n“Then I could have the nicest bits of chicken, and heaps of sauce on\\nmy pudding, and the butteryest slices of toast, and ALL the cream\\nfor my tea, as you do. It isn’t a VERY bad pain, is it?” asked Rosy,\\nin such perfect good faith that Miss Henny’s sudden flush and Roxy’s\\nhasty dive into the closet never suggested to her that this innocent\\nspeech was bringing the old lady’s besetting sin to light in the\\nmost open manner.\\n\\n“Yes, child, it is VERY bad, and you may thank your stars that I try\\nto keep you from it by feeding you on plain food. At my age, and\\nsuffering as I do, the best of everything is needed to keep up my\\nstrength,” said Miss Henny, tartly. But the largest plate of\\npudding, with “heaps of sauce,” went to the child this day, and when\\nthe fruit was served, an unusually small portion was put away for\\nthe invalid, who was obliged to sustain nature with frequent lunches\\nthrough the day and evening.\\n\\n“I’m s’prised that you suffer much, Cousin Henny. How brave you must\\nbe, not to cry about it, and go round in horrid pain, as you do, and\\ndress so nicely, and see people, and work ‘broidering, and make\\ncalls! I hope I shall be brave if I ever DO have ‘spepsia; but I\\nguess I shan’t, you take such care to give me small pieces every\\ntime.”\\n\\nWith which cheerful remark Rosy closed that part of the conversation\\nand returned to the delights of her new friend’s garden. But from\\nthat day, among other changes which began about this time, the\\nchild’s cup and plate were well filled, and the dread of adding to\\nher own sufferings seemed to curb the dyspeptic’s voracious\\nappetite. “A cheild was amang them takin’ notes,” and every one\\ninvoluntarily dreaded those clear eyes and that frank tongue, so\\ninnocently observing and criticising all that went on. Cicely had\\nalready been reminded of a neglected duty by Rosy’s reading to Miss\\nPenny, and tried to be more faithful in that, as in other services\\nwhich she owed the old lady. So the little missionary was evidently\\ngetting on, though quite unconscious of her work at home, so\\nabsorbed was she in her foreign mission; for, like many another\\nmissionary, the savage over the way was more interesting than the\\nselfish, slothful, or neglected souls at home.\\n\\nMiss Penny was charmed with her flowers and the friendly message\\nsent her, and to Rosy’s great delight went next day, in best bonnet\\nand gown, to make a call upon the old lady “who was poorly,” for\\nthat appeal could not be resisted. Rosy also, in honor of the great\\noccasion, wore HER best hat, and a white frock so stiff that she\\nlooked like a little opera dancer as the long black legs skipped\\nalong the street; for it was far too grand a visit to be paid\\nthrough a hole in the wall.\\n\\nIn the basket were certain delicacies for the old lady, and a card\\nhad been prepared, with the names of Miss Carey and Miss Rosamond\\nCarey beautifully written on it by Cis, who was dying to go, but\\ndared not after Rosy had told her Mr. Dover’s remark about young\\nladies.\\n\\nAs the procession of two paused at the door, both the young and the\\nold heart fluttered a little, for this was the first decided step\\ntoward reconciliation, and any check might spoil it all. The maid\\nstared, but civilly led these unexpected guests in and departed with\\nthe card. Miss Penny settled herself in a large chair and looked\\nabout with pensive interest at the familiar room. But Rosy made a\\nbee-line for the great tiger-skin, and regardless of her clean\\nfrock lay down on it to examine the head, which glared at her with\\nyellow eyes, showing all its sharp teeth in the most delightfully\\nnatural manner.\\n\\nMr. Dover came in with a formal bow, but Miss Penny put out both\\nhands, and said in her sweet old voice,--\\n\\n“Let us be friends again for the sake of your mother.”\\n\\nThat settled the matter at once, and Mr. Thomas was so eager to do\\nhis part that he not only shook the hands heartily, but kept them in\\nhis as he said like an honest man,--\\n\\n“My dear neighbor, I beg your pardon! _I_ was wrong, but I’m not too\\nproud to own it and say I’m glad to let by-gones be by-gones for the\\nsake of all. Now come and see my mother; she is longing for you.”\\n\\nWhat went on in the next room Rosy never knew or cared, for Mr.\\nThomas soon returned, and amused her so well, showing his treasures,\\nthat she forgot where she was till the maid came to say tea was\\nready.\\n\\n“Are we going to stay?” cried the little girl, beaming from under a\\nFeejee crown of feathers, which produced as comical an effect upon\\nher curly head as did the collar of shark’s teeth round her plump\\nneck or the great Japanese war-fan in her hand.\\n\\n“Yes, we have tea at five; come and turn it out. I’ve ordered the\\nlittle cups especially for you,” said her host, as he changed the\\nsmall Amazon to a pretty child again and led her away to preside at\\nthe table, where the quaint china and silver, and the dainty cake\\nand bread and butter proved much more attractive than the little old\\nlady in a big cap who patted her head and smiled at her.\\n\\nNever had Rosy enjoyed such a delicious meal; for the rapture of\\npouring real tea out of a pot shaped like a silver melon, into cups\\nas thin as egg-shells, and putting in sugar with tongs like claws,\\nnot to mention much thick cream, also spicy, plummy cakes that\\nmelted in one’s mouth, was too great for words.\\n\\nThe little maid was so absorbed in her new duties that she never\\nminded what the elders talked about, till the plates were empty, the\\npot ran dry, and no one could be prevailed on to have any more tea.\\nThen she leaned back in her chair and remarked with an air of calm\\nsatisfaction, as she looked from one to the other, and smiled that\\nengaging smile of hers,--\\n\\n“Isn’t being friends a great deal nicer than fighting and throwing\\ncats over walls and calling bad names?”\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh, and that cheerful sound seemed to\\ntune every one to the sweetest harmony, while the little peacemaker\\nwas passed round as if a last course of kisses was absolutely\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThen the party broke up, and Mr. Dover escorted his guests to their\\nown gate, to the great amazement of the neighbors and the very\\nvisible pride of Miss Button-Rose, who went up the walk with her\\nhead as high as if the wreath of daisies on her little hat had been\\na conqueror’s crown.\\n\\nNow that the first step had been taken, all would have gone smoothly\\nif Cicely, offended because Mr. Thomas took no notice of HER, had\\nnot put it into Miss Henny’s head that as the original quarrel began\\nbetween her and their neighbor, it would not be dignified to give in\\ntill Mr. Dover had come and begged pardon of HER as well as of Miss\\nPenny. This suited the foolish old lady, who never could forget\\ncertain plain words spoken in the heat of battle, though the kindly\\nones lately heard had much softened her heart toward the offender.\\n\\n“No, I shall not forget my dignity nor humble myself by going over\\nthere to apologize as Penelope has. SHE can do as she likes; and now\\nthat he has asked to be forgiven, there is perhaps no harm in HER\\nseeing the old lady. But with me it is different. _I_ was insulted,\\nand till Thomas Dover comes here and solemnly asks my pardon I will\\nNOT cross his threshold, no matter what bribes he sends,” said Miss\\nHenny, with an air of heroic firmness.\\n\\nBut it did cost her a pang when her sister went every now and then\\nto take tea with the old lady and came home full of pleasant news;\\nwhile Rosy prattled of the fine things she saw, the nice things she\\nhad to eat, and never failed to bring some gift to share, or to\\ndisplay to the exiles from Paradise. They ate the “bribes,” however,\\nas they called the fruit, admired the pretty trinkets and toys, and\\nlonged to share in the mild festivities of the pleasant house over\\nthe way, but stood firm in spite of all Rosy’s wiles, till something\\nunexpected happened to touch their hearts, conquer their foolish\\npride, and crown the little peacemaker’s efforts with success.\\n\\nOne August afternoon Cicely was discontentedly looking over her\\nsmall store of ornaments as she made ready for a party. She loved\\ngayety, and went about a great deal, leaving many duties undone, or\\nasking the little girl to attend to them for her, neglecting,\\nhowever, to show any gratitude for these small services so\\ncheerfully done.\\n\\nAs she sat tossing over her boxes, Button-Rose came in looking\\ntired and listless, for it was a hot day, and she had been out twice\\nto do errands for Cicely, besides trotting busily up and down to\\nwait on the old ladies while the young one put fresh ribbons on her\\ndress and curled her hair for the evening.\\n\\n“Could I lie on your sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and my legs\\nare SO tired,” said little Button, when her tap had been answered by\\na sharp “What do you want, child?”\\n\\n“No, I’m going to lie there myself and have a nap as soon as I’m\\ndone here. It’s cooler than the bed, and I must be fresh for\\nto-night,” said Cicely, too intent on her own affairs to see how\\nused up Rosy looked.\\n\\n“Then could I look at your pretty things if I don’t touch ‘em?”\\n asked the child, longing to peep into the interesting boxes\\nscattered on the table.\\n\\n“No, you can’t! I’m busy, and don’t want you asking questions and\\nmeddling. Go away and let me alone.”\\n\\nCicely spoke crossly, and waved her hand with a warning gesture,\\nthereby upsetting the tray which held the beads of the necklace she\\nhad decided to wear for want of something better.\\n\\n“There, now see what you’ve done! Pick up every one, and be quick,\\nfor I’m in a hurry.”\\n\\n“But I didn’t touch ‘em,” began poor Button, as she crept about\\nhunting for the black and white beads that looked like very ugly\\nmarbles.\\n\\n“Don’t talk; pick them up and then scamper; you are always in\\nmischief!” scolded Cis, vexed with herself, and the heat, and the\\naccident, and the whole world just then.\\n\\nRosy said no more, but several great tears dropped on the carpet as\\nshe groped in corners, under the bed, and behind the chairs for the\\nrun-aways; and when the last was found she put it in her tyrant’s\\nhand, saying, with a wistful look,--\\n\\n“I’m very sorry I troubled you. Seems to me if _I_ had a little\\ncousin, I’d love to have her play with my things, and I wouldn’t be\\ncross to her. Now I’ll go and try to AMOOSE myself with Bella; SHE\\nis always good to me.”\\n\\n“Run along then. Thank goodness that doll came when it did, for I’m\\ntired of ‘amoosing’ small girls as well as old ladies,” said Cis,\\nbusy with her beads, yet sorry she had been so petulant with patient\\nlittle Button, who seldom reproached her, being a cheery child, and\\nblessed with a sweet temper.\\n\\nRosy felt too languid to play; so when she had told Bella, the\\nLondon doll, her trials, and comforted herself with some kisses on\\nthe waxen cheeks, she roamed away to the summer-house, which was\\ncool and quiet, longing for some one to caress her; for the little\\nheart was homesick and the little head ached badly.\\n\\nThe “button-hole” had been made, the alley swept out, to the great\\ndismay of the spiders, earwigs, and toads, who had fled to quieter\\nquarters, and Rosy had leave to go and come when she liked if Mr.\\nDover did not object. He never did; and it was her greatest delight\\nto walk in the pretty garden at her own sweet will, always with the\\nhope of meeting its kindly owner, for now they were firm friends.\\nShe had been too busy for a run there that day; and now, as she\\npeeped in, it looked so shady and inviting, and it seemed so natural\\nto turn to her dear “missionary man” for entertainment, that she\\nwent straight up to his study window and peeped in.\\n\\nHe too seemed out of sorts that hot afternoon, for he sat leaning\\nhis head on both hands at the desk strewn with piles of old letters.\\nButton-Rose’s tender heart yearned over him at once, and stepping\\nquietly in at the long open window she went to him, saying in her\\ntenderest tone,--\\n\\n“Does your head ache, sir? Let me soft it as I do Papa’s; he says\\nthat always makes it more better. Please let me? I’d love to\\ndearly.”\\n\\n“Ah, my darling, I wish you could. But the pain is in my heart, and\\nnothing will ever cure it,” sighed Mr. Thomas, as he drew her close\\nand put his wrinkled yellow cheek to her soft one, which looked more\\nlike a damask rose than usual.\\n\\n“You have trials too, I s’pose. Mine trouble me to-day, so I came\\nover to see you. Shall I go away?” asked Rosy with a sigh and the\\nwistful look again.\\n\\n“No, stay, and we will comfort each other. Tell me your troubles,\\nButton, and perhaps I can help them,” the kind old gentleman said as\\nhe took her on his knee and stroked the curly head with a paternal\\ntouch.\\n\\nSo Rosy told her latest grief, and never saw the smile that crept\\nabout the lips that asked in a tone of deep interest,--\\n\\n“Well, what do you mean to do to that unkind Cicely?”\\n\\n“For a minute I wanted to slap her back when she tried to spat my\\nhands. Then I ‘membered that Mamma said a kiss for a blow was a good\\nthing, so I picked up the beads and planned to do it; but Cis looked\\nSO cross I couldn’t. If I had a pretty necklace I’d go and give it\\nto her, and then maybe she’d love me better.”\\n\\n“My dear little missionary, you SHALL have beads to win the heart of\\nYOUR heathen, if that is all you need. See here; take anything you\\nlike, and give it with the kiss.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover pulled open a drawer in the desk and\\ndisplayed a delightful collection of pretty, quaint, and curious\\ntrinkets picked up in foreign lands, and kept for keepsakes, since\\nno little daughters of his own lived to wear them.\\n\\n“How perf’ly dorgeous!” cried Rosy, who often fell into baby talk\\nwhen excited; and plunging in her hands, she revelled for some\\nminutes in sandal-wood cases, carved ivory fans, silver bangles,\\nbarbaric brooches, and necklaces of coral, shells, amber, and golden\\ncoins, that jingled musically.\\n\\n“What SHALL I take for her?” cried the little maid, bewildered by\\nsuch a mine of wealth. “You pick out one, Mr. Thomas, that will\\nplease her so much, ‘cause you never send her anything, and she\\ndon’t like it,” said Rosy, fearing that her own taste was not to be\\ntrusted, as she liked the shells and shark’s teeth ornaments best.\\n\\n“No, I’ll give YOU one, and you shall do as you like about giving it\\nto her. This, now, is really valuable and pretty, and any young lady\\nwould like to wear it. It makes me think of you, my Button, for it\\nis like sunshine, and the word cut on the little heart means peace.”\\n\\nMr. Dover held up a string of amber beads with its carved amulet,\\nand swung it to and fro where the light shone through it till each\\nbead looked like a drop of golden wine.\\n\\n“Yes, that is lovely, and it smells nice, too. She will be so\\ns’prised and pleased; I’ll go and take it to her right away,” cried\\nRosy, forgetting to ask anything for herself, in her delight at this\\nfine gift for Cis.\\n\\nBut as she lifted her head after he had fastened the clasp about her\\nneck, something in his face recalled the look it wore when she first\\ncame in, and putting both hands upon his shoulders, she said in her\\nsweet little way,--\\n\\n“You’ve made my troubles go away, can’t I make yours? You are SO\\nkind to me, I’d love to help you if I could.”\\n\\n“You do, my child, more than you know; for when I get you in my arms\\nit seems as if one of my poor babies had come back to me, and for a\\nminute I forget the three little graves far away in India.”\\n\\n“Three!” cried Button, like a sad, soft echo; and she clung to the\\npoor man as if trying to fill the empty arms with the love and pity\\nthat over-flowed the childish soul in her small body.\\n\\nThis was the comfort Mr. Thomas wanted, and for a few moments he\\njust cradled her on his hungry heart, crooning a Hindostanee\\nlullaby, while a few slow tears came dropping down upon the yellow\\nhead, so like those hidden for years under the Indian flowers.\\nPresently he seemed to come back from the happy past to which the\\nold letters had carried him. He wiped his eyes, and Rosy’s also,\\nwith the big purple silk handkerchief, and pressing some very\\ngrateful kisses on the hot cheeks, said cheerfully again,--\\n\\n“God bless you, child, that’s done me good! But don’t let it sadden\\nyou, dear; forget all about it, and tell no one what a sentimental\\nold fool I am.”\\n\\n“I never truly will! Only when you feel sorry about the poor little\\nbabies, let me come and give you cuddlings. They always make people\\nfeel more better, and I love ‘em, and don’t get any now my dear\\npeople are away.”\\n\\nSo the two made a tender little plan to comfort each other when\\nhearts were heavy with longings for the absent, and parted at the\\nsmall gate, both much cheered, and faster friends than ever.\\n\\nRosy hastened in with her peace-offering, forgetful now of headache\\nor loneliness as she sat patiently in the wide entry window-seat\\nlistening till some sound in Cicely’s room should show that she was\\nawake. Before that happened, however, poor Button fell asleep\\nherself, lulled by the quiet of the house,--for every one was\\nnapping,--and dreamed that Mr. Dover stood waving a rainbow over\\nhis head, while several Indian gods and three little girls were\\ndancing round him, hand in hand, to the tune of “Ring around a\\nrosy.”\\n\\nA loud yawn roused her, and there was Cis peeping out of her door to\\nsee what time it was by the old-fashioned clock on the landing. Up\\nscrambled the child, feeling dizzy and heavy-eyed, but so eager to\\ngive pleasure that she lost no time in saying, as she swung the\\nnecklace in the sunshine,--\\n\\n“See! this is for you, if you like it more better than the\\nthunder-and-lightning marbles, as Cousin Penny calls the one you\\nwere going to wear.”\\n\\n“How lovely! Where DID you get it, child?” cried Cis, wide awake at\\nonce, as she ran to the glass to try the effect of the new ornament\\non her white neck.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Thomas gave it to me; but he said I could give it away\\nif I liked, and I want you to have it, ‘cause it’s ever so much\\nprettier than any you’ve got.”\\n\\n“That’s very kind of you, Chicken, but why not keep it yourself? You\\nlike nice things as well as I do,” said Cicely, much impressed by\\nthe value of the gift, for it was real amber, and the clasp of gold.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve talked with Mr. Thomas about missionarying a great deal,\\nand he told me how he made the savinges good by giving them beads,\\nand things to eat, and being patient and kind to them. So I thought\\nI’d play be a missionary, and call this house Africa, and try to\\nmake the people here behave more better,” answered Rosy, with such\\nengaging earnestness, as well as frankness, that Cis laughed, and\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“You impertinent monkey, to call us heathen and try to convert us!\\nHow do you expect to do it?”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m getting on pretty well, only you don’t CONVERT as quick as\\nsome of the savinges did. I’ll tell you about it;” and Button went\\non eagerly. “Cousin Penny is the good old one, but rather fussy and\\nslow, so I’m kind and patient, and now she loves me and lets me do\\nthings I like. She is my best one. Cousin Henny is my cannybel,\\n‘cause she eats so much, and I please HER by bringing nice things\\nand getting her cushions ready. You are my baddest one, who is cross\\nto me, and fights, and raps my head, and slaps my hands; so I\\nthought some beads would be nice for you, and I bringed these\\nbeauties. Mr. Thomas gave ‘em to me when I told him my trials.”\\n\\nCicely looked angry, amused, and ashamed, as she listened to the\\nfunny yet rather pathetic little play with which the lonely child\\nhad tried to cheer herself and win the hearts of those about her.\\nShe had the grace to blush, and offer back the necklace, saying in a\\nself-reproachful tone,--\\n\\n“Keep your beads, little missionary, I’ll be converted without them,\\nand try to be kinder to you. I AM a selfish wretch, but you shall\\nplay be my little sister, and not have to go to strangers for\\ncomfort in your trials any more. Come, kiss me, dear, and we’ll\\nbegin now.”\\n\\nRosy was in her arms at once, and clung there, saying with a face\\nall smiles,--\\n\\n“That’s what I wanted! I thought I’d make a good savinge of you if I\\ntried VERY hard. Please be kind to me just till Mamma comes back,\\nand I’ll be the best little sister that ever was.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you tell me all about it before?” asked Cicely,\\nsmoothing the tired head on her shoulder with a new gentleness; for\\nthis last innocent confession had touched her heart as well as her\\nconscience.\\n\\n“You never seemed to care about my plays, and always said, ‘Don’t\\nchatter, child; run away and take care of yourself.’ So I did; but\\nit was pretty dull, with only Tabby to tell secrets to and Bella to\\nkiss. Mr. Thomas said people over here didn’t like children very\\nwell, and I found they didn’t. HE does, dearly, so I went to him;\\nbut I like you now, you are so soft and kind to me.”\\n\\n“How hot your cheeks are! Come and let me cool them, and brush your\\nhair for tea,” said Cis, as she touched the child’s feverish skin,\\nand saw how heavy her eyes were.\\n\\n“I’m all burning up, and my head is SO funny. I don’t want any tea.\\nI want to lie on your sofa and go to sleep again. Can I?” asked\\nRosy, with a dizzy look about the room, and a shiver at the idea of\\neating.\\n\\n“Yes, dear, I’ll put on your little wrapper, and make you all\\ncomfortable, and bring you some ice-water, for your lips are very\\ndry.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Cicely bustled about the room, and soon had Rosy\\nnicely settled with her best cologne-bottle and a fan; then she\\nhastened down to report that something was wrong, with a fear in her\\nown heart that if any harm did come to the child it would be her\\nfault. Some days before Cicely had sent Button-Rose with a note to a\\nfriend’s house where she knew some of the younger children were ill.\\nSince then she had heard that it was scarlet fever; but though Rosy\\nhad waited some time for an answer to the note, and seen one of the\\ninvalids, Cis had never mentioned the fact, being ashamed to confess\\nher carelessness, hoping no harm was done. Now she felt that it HAD\\ncome, and went to tell gentle Cousin Penny with tears of vain\\nregret.\\n\\nGreat was the lamentation when the doctor, who was sent for in hot\\nhaste, pronounced it scarlet fever; and deep was the self-reproach\\nof the two older women for their blindness in not before remarking\\nthe languid air and want of appetite in the child. But Cicely was\\nfull of remorse; for every quick word, every rap of the hateful\\nthimble, every service accepted without thanks, weighed heavily on\\nher conscience now, as such things have an inconvenient way of doing\\nwhen it is too late to undo them. Every one was devoted to the\\nchild, even lazy Miss Henny gave up her naps to sit by her at all\\nhours, Miss Penny hovered over the little bed like a grandmother,\\nand Cicely refused to think of pleasure till the danger was over.\\n\\nFor soon Button-Rose was very ill, and the old house haunted by the\\ndreadful fear that death would rob them of the little creature who\\ngrew so precious when the thought of losing her made their hearts\\nstand still. How could they live without the sound of that sweet\\nvoice chirping about the house, the busy feet tripping up and down,\\nthe willing hands trying to help, the sunny face smiling at every\\none, and going away into corners to hide the tears that sometimes\\ncame to dim its brightness? What would comfort the absent mother for\\nsuch a loss as this, and how could they answer to the father for the\\ncarelessness that risked the child’s life for a girl’s errand? No\\none dared to think, and all prayed heartily for Rosy’s life, as they\\nwatched and waited by the little bed where she lay so patiently,\\ntill the fever grew high and she began to babble about many things.\\nHer childish trials were all told, her longings for Mamma, whose\\nplace no one could fill, her quaint little criticisms upon those\\nabout her, and her plans for making peace. These innocent\\nrevelations caused many tears, and wrought some changes in those who\\nheard; for Miss Penny quite forgot her infirmities to live in the\\nsick-room as the most experienced nurse and tenderest watcher. Miss\\nHenny cooked her daintiest gruel, brewed her coolest drinks, and\\nlost many pounds in weight by her indefatigable trotting up and down\\nto minister to the invalid’s least caprice. Cicely was kept away for\\nfear of infection, but HER penance was to wander about the great\\nhouse, more silent than ever now, to answer the inquiries and listen\\nto the sad forebodings of the neighbors, who came to offer help and\\nsympathy; for all loved little Button-Rose, and grieved to think of\\nany blight falling on the pretty blossom. To wile away the long\\nhours, Cicely fell to dusting the empty rooms, setting closets and\\ndrawers to rights, and keeping all fresh and clean, to the great\\nrelief of the old cousins, who felt that everything would go to\\ndestruction in their absence. She read and sewed now, having no\\nheart for jaunting about; and as she made the long neglected white\\npinafores, for Rosy, she thought much of the little girl who might\\nnever live to wear them.\\n\\nMeantime the fever took its course, and came at last to the fateful\\nday when a few hours would settle the question of life or death. The\\nhot flush died out of the cheeks that had lost their soft roundness\\nnow, the lips were parched, the half-shut eyes looked like sick\\nviolets, and all the pretty curls were tangled on the pillow. Rosy\\nno longer sung to Bella, talked of “three dear little girls” and Mr.\\nThomas, tigers and bangles, Cis and necklaces, hens and gates. She\\nceased to call for Mamma, asked no more why her “missionary man”\\n never came, and took no notice of the anxious old faces bending over\\nher. She lay in a stupor, and the doctor held the little wasted\\nhand, and tried to see the face of his watch with dim eyes as he\\ncounted the faint pulse, whispering solemnly,--\\n\\n“We can only hope and wait now. Sleep alone can save her.”\\n\\nAs the sisters sat, one on either side the narrow bed that day, and\\nCicely walked restlessly up and down the long hall below, where both\\ndoors stood open to let in the cool evening air, as the sun went\\ndown, a quick but quiet step came up the steps, and Mr. Dover walked\\nin without ringing. He had been away, and coming home an hour ago,\\nheard the sad news. Losing not a moment, he hurried to ask about his\\nlittle Button, and his face showed how great his love and fear were,\\nas he said in a broken whisper,--\\n\\n“Will she live? My mother never told me how serious it was, or I\\nshould have returned at once.”\\n\\n“We hope so, sir, but--” And there Cicely’s voice failed, as she hid\\nher face and sobbed.\\n\\n“My dear girl, don’t give way. Keep up your heart, hope, pray, will\\nthat the darling SHALL live, and that may do some good. We can’t let\\nher go! we won’t let her go! Let me see her; I know much of fevers\\nfar worse than this, and might be able to suggest something,” begged\\nMr. Dover, throwing down his hat, and waving an immense fan with\\nsuch an air of resolution and cheery good-will that tired Cis felt\\ncomforted at once, and led the way upstairs entirely forgetting the\\ngreat feud, as he did.\\n\\nAt the threshold of the door he paused, till the girl had whispered\\nhis name. Miss Penny, always a gentlewoman, rose at once and went\\nto meet him, but Miss Henny did not even seem to see him, for just\\nthen, as if dimly feeling that her friend was near, Rosy stirred,\\nand gave a long sigh.\\n\\nSilently the three stood and looked at the beloved little creature\\nlying there in the mysterious shadow of death, and they so helpless\\nto keep her if the hour for departure had come.\\n\\n“God help us!” sighed pious Miss Penny, folding her old hands, as if\\nthey did that often now.\\n\\n“Drifting away, I fear;” and Miss Henny’s plump face looked almost\\nbeautiful, with the tears on it, as she leaned nearer to listen to\\nthe faint breath at the child’s lips.\\n\\n“No; we will keep her, please the Lord! If we can make her sleep\\nquietly for the next few hours she is safe. Let me try. Fan slowly\\nwith this, Miss Henrietta, and you, dear lady, pray that the\\nprecious little life may be given us.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Dover gave the great fan to Miss Henny, took the\\nsmall cold hands in his, and sitting on the bedside held them close\\nin his large warm ones, as if trying to pour life and strength into\\nthe frail body, as his eyes, fixed on the half-opened ones, seemed\\nto call back the innocent soul hovering on the threshold of its\\nprison, like the butterfly poised upon the chrysalis before it soars\\naway.\\n\\nMiss Penny knelt down near by, and laying her white head on the\\nother pillow, again besought God to spare this treasure to the\\nfather and mother over the sea. How long they remained so none of\\nthem ever knew, silent and motionless but for the slow waving of the\\nnoiseless fan, which went to and fro like the wing of a great white\\nbird, as if Miss Henny’s stout arm could never tire. Miss Penny was\\nso still she seemed to be asleep. Mr. Dover never stirred, but grew\\npaler as the minutes passed; and Cicely, creeping now and then to\\nlook in and steal away, saw strange power in the black eyes that\\nseemed to hold the fluttering spirit of the little child by the love\\nand longing that made them both tender and commanding.\\n\\nA level ray of sunlight stole through the curtain at last and turned\\nthe tangles of bright hair to pure gold. Miss Henny rose to shut it\\nout, and as if her movement broke the spell, Rosy took a long full\\nbreath, turned on the pillow, and putting one hand under her cheek,\\nseemed to fall asleep as naturally as she used to do when well. Miss\\nPenny looked up, touched the child’s forehead, and whispered, with a\\nlook of gratitude as bright as if the sunshine had touched her\\nalso,--\\n\\n“It is moist! this is real sleep! Oh, my baby! oh, my baby!” And the\\nold head went down again with a stifled sob, for her experienced eye\\ntold her that the danger was passing by and Rosy would live.\\n\\n“The prayers of the righteous avail much,” murmured Mr. Dover,\\nturning to the other lady, who stood beside her sister looking down\\nat the little figure now lying so restfully between them.\\n\\n“How can we thank you?” she whispered, offering her hand, with the\\nsmile which had once made her pretty, and still touched the old face\\nwith something better than beauty.\\n\\nMr. Dover took the hand and answered, with an eloquent look at the\\nchild,--\\n\\n“Let not the sun go down upon our wrath. Forgive me and be friends\\nagain, for her sake.”\\n\\n“I will!” And the plump hands gave the thin ones a hearty shake as\\nthe great feud ended forever over the bed of the little peacemaker\\nwhose childish play had turned to happy earnest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR\\n\\n\\n“Here’s your breakfast, miss. I hope it’s right. Your mother showed\\nme how to fix it, and said I’d find a cup up here.”\\n\\n“Take that blue one. I have not much appetite, and can’t eat if\\nthings are not nice and pretty. I like the flowers. I’ve been\\nlonging for some ever since I saw them last night.”\\n\\nThe first speaker was a red-haired, freckle-faced girl, in a brown\\ncalico dress and white apron, with a tray in her hands and an air of\\ntimid hospitality in her manner; the second a pale, pretty creature,\\nin a white wrapper and blue net, sitting in a large chair, looking\\nabout her with the languid interest of an invalid in a new place.\\nHer eyes brightened as they fell upon a glass of rosy laurel and\\ndelicate maidenhair fern that stood among the toast and eggs,\\nstrawberries and cream, on the tray.\\n\\n“Our laurel is jest in blow, and I’m real glad you come in time to\\nsee it. I’ll bring you a lot, as soon’s ever I get time to go for\\nit.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, the plain girl replaced the ugly crockery cup and\\nsaucer with the pretty china ones pointed out to her, arranged the\\ndishes, and waited to see if anything else was needed.\\n\\n“What is your name, please?” asked the pretty girl, refreshing\\nherself with a draught of new milk.\\n\\n“Rebecca. Mother thought I’d better wait on you; the little girls\\nare so noisy and apt to forget. Wouldn’t you like a piller to your\\nback? you look so kind of feeble seems as if you wanted to be\\npropped up a mite.”\\n\\nThere was so much compassion and good-will in the face and voice,\\nthat Emily accepted the offer, and let Rebecca arrange a cushion\\nbehind her; then, while the one ate daintily, and the other stirred\\nabout an inner room, the talk went on,--for two girls are seldom\\nlong silent when together.\\n\\n“I think the air is going to suit me, for I slept all night and\\nnever woke till Mamma had been up ever so long and got things all\\nnicely settled,” said Emily, graciously, when the fresh strawberries\\nhad been enjoyed, and the bread and butter began to vanish.\\n\\n“I’m real glad you like it; most folks do, if they don’t mind it\\nbeing plain and quiet up here. It’s gayer down at the hotel, but the\\nair ain’t half so good, and delicate folks generally like our old\\nplace best,” answered Becky, as she tossed over a mattress and shook\\nout the sheet with a brisk, capable air pleasant to see.\\n\\n“I wanted to go to the hotel, but the doctor said it would be too\\nnoisy for me, so Mamma was glad to find rooms here. I didn’t think a\\nfarm-house COULD be so pleasant. That view is perfectly splendid!”\\n and Emily sat up to gaze delightedly out of the window, below which\\nspread the wide intervale, through which the river ran with\\nhay-fields on either side, while along the green slopes of the hills\\nlay farm-houses with garden plots, and big barns waiting for the\\nharvest; and beyond, the rocky, wooded pastures dotted with cattle\\nand musical with cow-bells, brooks, and birds.\\n\\nA balmy wind kissed a little color into the pale cheeks, the\\nlistless eyes brightened as they looked, and the fretful lines\\nvanished from lips that smiled involuntarily at the sweet welcome\\nNature gave the city child come to rest and play and grow gay and\\nrosy in her green lap.\\n\\nBecky watched her with interest, and was glad to see how soon the\\nnew-comer felt the charm of the place, for the girl loved her\\nmountain home, and thought the old farm-house the loveliest spot in\\nthe world.\\n\\n“When you get stronger I can show you lots of nice views round here.\\nThere’s a woodsy place behind the house that’s just lovely. Down by\\nthe laurel bushes is MY favorite spot, and among the rocks is a cave\\nwhere I keep things handy when I get a resting-spell now and then,\\nand want to be quiet. Can’t get much at home, when there’s boarders\\nand five children round in vacation time.”\\n\\nBecky laughed as she spoke, and there was a sweet motherly look in\\nher plain face, as she glanced at the three little red heads bobbing\\nabout the door-yard below, where hens cackled, a pet lamb fed, and\\nthe old white dog lay blinking in the sun.\\n\\n“I like children; we have none at home, and Mamma makes such a baby\\nof me I’m almost ashamed sometimes. I want her to have a good rest\\nnow, for she has taken care of me all winter and needs it. You shall\\nbe my nurse, if I need one; but I hope to be so well soon that I can\\nsee to myself. It’s so tiresome to be ill!” and Emily sighed as she\\nleaned back among her pillows, with a glance at the little glass\\nwhich showed her a thin face and shorn head.\\n\\n“It must be! I never was sick, but I have taken care of sick folks,\\nand have a sight of sympathy for ‘em. Mother says I make a pretty\\ngood nurse, being strong and quiet,” answered Becky, plumping up\\npillows and folding towels with a gentle despatch which was very\\ngrateful to the invalid, who had dreaded a noisy, awkward\\nserving-maid.\\n\\n“Never ill! how nice that must be! I’m always having colds and\\nheadaches, and fusses of some kind. What do you do to keep well,\\nRebecca?” asked Emily, watching her with interest, as she came in to\\nremove the tray.\\n\\n“Nothing but work; I haven’t time to be sick, and when I’m tuckered\\nout, I go and rest over yonder. Then I’m all right, and buckle to\\nagain, as smart as ever;” and every freckle in Becky’s rosy face\\nseemed to shine with cheerful strength and courage.\\n\\n“I’m ‘tuckered out’ doing nothing,” said Emily, amused with the new\\nexpression, and eager to try a remedy which showed such fine results\\nin this case. “I shall visit your pet places and do a little work as\\nsoon as I am able, and see if it won’t set me up. Now I can only\\ndawdle, doze, and read a little. Will you please put those books\\nhere on the table? I shall want them by-and-by.”\\n\\nEmily pointed to a pile of blue and gold volumes lying on a trunk,\\nand Becky dusted her hands as she took them up with an air of\\nreverence, for she read on the backs of the volumes names which made\\nher eyes sparkle.\\n\\n“Do you care for poetry?” asked Emily, surprised at the girl’s look\\nand manner.\\n\\n“Guess I do! don’t get much except the pieces I cut out of papers,\\nbut I love ‘em, and stick ‘em in an old ledger, and keep it down in\\nmy cubby among the rocks. I do love THAT man’s pieces. They seem to\\ngo right to the spot somehow;” and Becky smiled at the name of\\nWhittier as if the sweetest of our poets was a dear old friend of\\nhers.\\n\\n“I like Tennyson better. Do you know him?” asked Emily, with a\\nsuperior air, for the idea of this farmer’s daughter knowing\\nanything about poetry amused her.\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve got a number of his pieces in my book, and I’m fond of\\n‘em. But this man makes things so kind of true and natural I feel at\\nhome with HIM. And this one I’ve longed to read, though I guess I\\ncan’t understand much of it. His ‘Bumble Bee’ was just lovely; with\\nthe grass and columbines and the yellow breeches of the bee. I’m\\nnever tired of that;” and Becky’s face woke up into something like\\nbeauty as she glanced hungrily at the Emerson while she dusted the\\ndelicate cover that hid the treasures she coveted.\\n\\n“I don’t care much for him, but Mamma does. I like romantic poems,\\nand ballads, and songs; don’t like descriptions of clouds and\\nfields, and bees, and farmers,” said Emily, showing plainly that\\neven Emerson’s simplest poems were far above her comprehension as\\nyet, because she loved sentiment more than Nature.\\n\\n“I do, because I know ‘em better than love and the romantic stuff\\nmost poetry tells about. But I don’t pretend to judge, I’m glad of\\nanything I can get. Now if you don’t want me I’ll pick up my dishes\\nand go to work.”\\n\\nWith that Becky went away, leaving Emily to rest and dream with her\\neyes on the landscape which was giving her better poetry than any\\nher books held. She told her mother about the odd girl, and was sure\\nshe would be amusing if she did not forget her place and try to be\\nfriends.\\n\\n“She is a good creature, my dear, her mother’s main stay, and works\\nbeyond her strength, I am sure. Be kind to the poor girl, and put a\\nlittle pleasure into her life if you can,” answered Mrs. Spenser, as\\nshe moved about, settling comforts and luxuries for her invalid.\\n\\n“I shall HAVE to talk to her, as there is no other person of my age\\nin the house. How are the school marms? shall you get on with them,\\nMamma? It will be so lonely here for us both, if we don’t make\\nfriends with some one.”\\n\\n“Most intelligent and amiable women all three, and we shall have\\npleasant times together, I am sure. You may safely cultivate Becky;\\nMrs. Taylor told me she was a remarkably bright girl, though she may\\nnot look it.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see. But I do hate freckles and big red hands, and round\\nshoulders. She can’t help it, I suppose, but ugly things fret me.”\\n\\n“Remember that she has no time to be pretty, and be glad she is so\\nneat and willing. Shall we read, dear? I’m ready now.”\\n\\nEmily consented, and listened for an hour or two while the pleasant\\nvoice beside her conjured away all her vapors with some of Mrs.\\nEwing’s charming tales.\\n\\n“The grass is dry now, and I want to stroll on that green lawn\\nbefore lunch. You rest, Mamma dear, and let me make discoveries all\\nalone,” proposed Emily, when the sun shone warmly, and the instinct\\nof all young creatures for air and motion called her out.\\n\\nSo, with her hat and wrap, and book and parasol, she set forth to\\nexplore the new land in which she found herself.\\n\\nDown the wide, creaking stairs and out upon the door-stone she went,\\npausing there for a moment to decide where first to go. The sound of\\nsome one singing in the rear of the house led her in that direction,\\nand turning the corner she made her first pleasant discovery. A hill\\nrose steeply behind the farm-house, and leaning from the bank was an\\nold apple-tree, shading a spring that trickled out from the rocks\\nand dropped into a mossy trough below. Up the tree had grown a wild\\ngrape-vine, making a green canopy over the great log which served as\\na seat, and some one had planted maidenhair ferns about both seat\\nand spring to flourish beautifully in the damp, shady spot.\\n\\n“Oh, how pretty! I’ll go and sit there. It looks clean, and I can\\nsee what is going on in that big kitchen, and hear the singing. I\\nsuppose it’s Becky’s little sisters by the racket.”\\n\\nEmily established herself on the lichen-covered log with her feet\\nupon a stone, and sat enjoying the musical tinkle of the water, with\\nher eyes on the delicate ferns stirring in the wind, and the lively\\njingle of the multiplication-table chanted by childish voices in her\\near.\\n\\nPresently two little girls with a great pan of beans came to do\\ntheir work on the back doorstep, a third was seen washing dishes at\\na window, and Becky’s brown-spotted gown flew about the kitchen as\\nif a very energetic girl wore it. A woman’s voice was heard giving\\ndirections, as the speaker was evidently picking chickens somewhere\\nout of sight.\\n\\nA little of the talk reached Emily and both amused and annoyed her,\\nfor it proved that the country people were not as stupid as they\\nlooked.\\n\\n“Oh, well, we mustn’t mind if she IS notional and kind of wearing;\\nshe’s been sick, and it will take time to get rid of her fretty\\nways. Jest be pleasant, and take no notice, and that nice mother of\\nhers will make it all right,” said the woman’s voice.\\n\\n“How anybody with every mortal thing to be happy with CAN be\\nout-of-sorts passes me. She fussed about every piller, chair, trunk,\\nand mite of food last night, and kept that poor tired lady trotting\\ntill I was provoked. She’s right pleasant this morning though, and\\nas pretty as a picture in her ruffled gown and that blue thing on\\nher head,” answered Becky from the pantry, as she rattled out the\\npie-board, little dreaming who sat hidden behind the grape-vine\\nfestoons that veiled the corner by the spring.\\n\\n“Well, she’s got redder hair ‘n’ we have, so she needn’t be so grand\\nand try to hide it with blue nets,” added one little voice.\\n\\n“Yes, and it’s ever so much shorter ‘n’ ours, and curls all over her\\nhead like Daisy’s wool. I should think such a big girl would feel\\nreal ashamed without no braids,” said the other child, proudly\\nsurveying the tawny mane that hung over her shoulders,--for like\\nmost red-haired people all the children were blessed with luxuriant\\ncrops of every shade from golden auburn to regular carrots.\\n\\n“I think it’s lovely. Suppose it had to be cut off when she had the\\nfever. Wish I could get rid of my mop, it’s such a bother;” and\\nBecky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that made her\\nhead look very like a copper kettle.\\n\\n“Now fly round, deary, and get them pies ready. I’ll have these\\nfowls on in a minute, and then go to my butter. You run off and see\\nif you can’t find some wild strawberries for the poor girl, soon’s\\never you are through with them beans, children. We must kind of\\npamper her up for a spell till her appetite comes back,” said the\\nmother.\\n\\nHere the chat ended, and soon the little girls were gone, leaving\\nBecky alone rolling out pie-crust before the pantry window. As she\\nworked her lips moved, and Emily, still peeping through the leaves,\\nwondered what she was saying, for a low murmur rose and fell,\\nemphasized now and then with a thump of the rolling-pin.\\n\\n“I mean to go and find out. If I stand on that wash-bench I can look\\nin and see her work. I’ll show them all that _I_‘m NOT ‘fussy,’ and\\ncan be ‘right pleasant’ if I like.”\\n\\nWith this wise resolution Emily went down the little path, and after\\npausing to examine the churn set out to dry, and the row of pans\\nshining on a neighboring shelf, made her way to the window, mounted\\nthe bench while Becky’s back was turned, and pushing away the\\nmorning-glory vines and scarlet beans that ran up on either side\\npeeped in with such a smiling face that the crossest cook could not\\nhave frowned on her as an intruder.\\n\\n“May I see you work? I can’t eat pies, but I like to watch people\\nmake them. Do you mind?”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I’d ask you to come in, but it’s dreadful hot here, and\\nnot much room,” answered Becky, crimping round the pastry before she\\npoured in the custard. “I’m going to make a nice little pudding for\\nyou; your mother said you liked ‘em; or would you rather have\\nwhipped cream with a mite of jelly in it?” asked Becky, anxious to\\nsuit her new boarder.\\n\\n“Whichever is easiest to make. I don’t care what I eat. Do tell me\\nwhat you were saying. It sounded like poetry,” said Emily, leaning\\nboth elbows on the wide ledge with a pale pink morning-glory kissing\\nher cheek, and a savory odor reaching her nose.\\n\\n“Oh, I was mumbling some verses. I often do when I work, it sort of\\nhelps me along; but it must sound dreadfully silly,” and Becky\\nblushed as if caught in some serious fault.\\n\\n“I do it, and it’s a great comfort when I lie awake. I should think\\nyou WOULD want something to help you along, you work so hard. Do you\\nlike it, Becky?”\\n\\nThe familiar name, the kind tone, made the plain face brighten with\\npleasure as its owner said, while she carefully filled a pretty bowl\\nwith a golden mixture rich with fresh eggs and country milk--\\n\\n“No, I don’t, but I ought to. Mother isn’t as strong as she used to\\nbe, and there’s a sight to do, and the children to be brought up,\\nand the mortgage to be paid off; so if _I_ don’t fly round, who\\nwill? We are doing real well now, for Mr. Walker manages the farm\\nand gives us our share, so our living is all right; then boarders in\\nsummer and my school in winter helps a deal, and every year the boys\\ncan do more, so I’d be a real sinner to complain if I do have to\\nstep lively all day.”\\n\\nBecky smiled as she spoke, and straightened her bent shoulders as if\\nsettling her burden for another trudge along the path of duty.\\n\\n“Do you keep school? Why, how old are you, Becky?” asked Emily, much\\nimpressed by this new discovery.\\n\\n“I’m eighteen. I took the place of a teacher who got sick last fall,\\nand I kept school all winter. Folks seemed to like me, and I’m going\\nto have the same place this year. I’m so glad, for I needn’t go away\\nand the pay is pretty good, as the school is large and the children\\ndo well. You can see the school-house down the valley, that red\\nbrick one where the roads meet;” and Becky pointed a floury finger,\\nwith an air of pride that was pleasant to see.\\n\\nEmily glanced at the little red house where the sun shone hotly in\\nsummer, and all the winds of heaven must rage wildly in winter time,\\nfor it stood, as country schools usually do, in the barest, most\\nuninviting spot for miles around.\\n\\n“Isn’t it awful down there in winter?” she asked, with a shiver at\\nthe idea of spending days shut up in that forlorn place, with a\\ncrowd of rough country children.\\n\\n“Pretty cold, but we have plenty of wood, and we are used to snow\\nand gales up here. We often coast down, the whole lot of us, and\\nthat is great fun. We take our dinners and have games noon-spells,\\nand so we get on first rate; some of my boys are big fellows, older\\nthan I am; they clear the roads and make the fire and look after us,\\nand we are real happy together.”\\n\\nEmily found it so impossible to imagine happiness under such\\ncircumstances that she changed the subject by asking in a tone which\\nhad unconsciously grown more respectful since this last revelation\\nof Becky’s abilities,--\\n\\n“If you do so well here, why don’t you try for a larger school in a\\nbetter place?”\\n\\n“Oh, I couldn’t leave mother yet; I hope to some day, when the girls\\nare older, and the boys able to get on alone. But I can’t go now,\\nfor there’s a sight of things to do, and mother is always laid up\\nwith rheumatism in cold weather. So much butter-making down cellar\\nis bad for her; but she won’t let me do that in summer, so I take\\ncare of her in winter. I can see to things night and morning, and\\nthrough the day she’s quiet, and sits piecing carpet-rags and\\nresting up for next spring. We made and wove all the carpets in the\\nhouse, except the parlor one. Mrs. Taylor gave us that, and the\\ncurtains, and the easy-chair. Mother takes a sight of comfort in\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor is the lady who first came to board here, and told us\\nand others about it,” said Emily.\\n\\n“Yes, and she’s the kindest lady in the world! I’ll tell you all\\nabout her some day, it’s real interesting; now I must see to my\\npies, and get the vegetables on,” answered Becky, glancing at the\\ngay clock in the kitchen with an anxious look.\\n\\n“Then I won’t waste any more of your precious time. May I sit in\\nthat pretty place; or is it your private bower?” asked Emily, as she\\ndismounted from the wash-bench.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed you may. That’s mother’s resting-place when work is\\ndone. Father made the spring long ago, and I put the ferns there.\\nShe can’t go rambling round, and she likes pretty things, so we\\nfixed it up for her, and she takes comfort there nights.”\\n\\nBecky bustled off to the oven with her pies, and Emily roamed away\\nto the big barn to lie on the hay, enjoying the view down the\\nvalley, as she thought over what she had seen and heard, and very\\nnaturally contrasted her own luxurious and tenderly guarded life\\nwith this other girl’s, so hard and dull and narrow. Working all\\nsummer and teaching all winter in that dismal little school-house,\\nwith no change but home cares and carpet-weaving! It looked horrible\\nto pleasure-loving Emily, who led the happy, care-free life of\\ngirls of her class, with pleasures of all sorts, and a future of\\nstill greater luxury, variety, and happiness, opening brightly\\nbefore her.\\n\\nIt worried her to think of any one being contented with such a\\nmeagre share of the good things of life, when she was unsatisfied in\\nspite of the rich store showered upon her. She could not understand\\nit, and fell asleep wishing every one could be comfortable,--it was\\nso annoying to see them grubbing in kitchens, teaching in bleak\\nschool-houses among snow-drifts, and wearing ugly calico gowns.\\n\\nA week or two of quiet, country fare and the bracing mountain air\\nworked wonders for the invalid, and every one rejoiced to see the\\npale cheeks begin to grow round and rosy, the languid eyes to\\nbrighten, and the feeble girl who used to lie on her sofa half the\\nday now go walking about with her alpenstock, eager to explore all\\nthe pretty nooks among the hills. Her mother blessed Mrs. Taylor for\\nsuggesting this wholesome place. The tired “school marms,” as Emily\\ncalled the three young women who were their fellow-boarders,\\ncongratulated her as well as themselves on the daily improvement in\\nstrength and spirits all felt; and Becky exulted in the marvellous\\neffects of her native air, aided by mother’s good cookery and the\\ncheerful society of the children, whom the good girl considered the\\nmost remarkable and lovable youngsters in the world.\\n\\nEmily felt like the queen of this little kingdom, and was regarded\\nas such by every one, for with returning health she lost her fretful\\nways, and living with simple people, soon forgot her girlish airs\\nand vanities, becoming very sweet and friendly with all about her.\\nThe children considered her a sort of good fairy who could grant\\nwishes with magical skill, as various gifts plainly proved. The boys\\nwere her devoted servants, ready to run errands, “hitch up” and take\\nher to drive at any hour, or listen in mute delight when she sang to\\nher guitar in the summer twilight.\\n\\nBut to Becky she was a special godsend and comfort, for before the\\nfirst month had gone they were good friends, and Emily had made a\\ndiscovery which filled her head with brilliant plans for Becky’s\\nfuture, in spite of her mother’s warnings, and the sensible\\ngirl’s own reluctance to be dazzled by enthusiastic prophecies and\\ndreams.\\n\\nIt came about in this way. Some three weeks after the two girls met,\\nEmily went one evening to their favorite trysting-place,--Becky’s\\nbower among the laurels. It was a pretty nook in the shadow of a\\ngreat gray bowlder near the head of the green valley which ran down\\nto spread into the wide intervale below. A brook went babbling among\\nthe stones and grass and sweet-ferns, while all the slope was rosy\\nwith laurel-flowers in their times, as the sturdy bushes grew\\nthickly on the hill-side, down the valley, and among the woods that\\nmade a rich background for these pink and white bouquets arranged\\nwith Nature’s own careless grace.\\n\\nEmily liked this spot, and ever since she had been strong enough to\\nreach it, loved to climb up and sit there with book and work,\\nenjoying the lovely panorama before her. Floating mists often gave\\nher a constant succession of pretty pictures; now a sunny glimpse of\\nthe distant lake, then the church spire peeping above the hill, or a\\nflock of sheep feeding in the meadow, a gay procession of young\\npilgrims winding up the mountain, or a black cloud heavy with a\\ncoming storm, welcome because of the glorious rainbow and its shadow\\nwhich would close the pageant.\\n\\nUnconsciously the girl grew to feel not only the beauty but the\\nvalue of these quiet hours, to find a new peace, refreshment, and\\nhappiness, bubbling up in her heart as naturally as the brook gushed\\nout among the mossy rocks, and went singing away through hayfields\\nand gardens, and by dusty roads, till it met the river and rolled on\\nto the sea. Something dimly stirred in her, and the healing spirit\\nthat haunts such spots did its sweet ministering till the innocent\\nsoul began to see that life was not perfect without labor as well as\\nlove, duty as well as happiness, and that true contentment came from\\nwithin, not from without.\\n\\nOn the evening we speak of, she went to wait for Becky, who would\\njoin her as soon as the after-supper chores were done. In the little\\ncave which held a few books, a dipper, and a birch-bark basket for\\nberries, Emily kept a sketching block and a box of pencils, and\\noften amused herself by trying to catch some of the lovely scenes\\nbefore her. These efforts usually ended in a humbler attempt, and a\\ngood study of an oak-tree, a bit of rock, or a clump of ferns was\\nthe result. This evening the sunset was so beautiful she could not\\ndraw, and remembering that somewhere in Becky’s scrap-book there was\\na fine description of such an hour by some poet, she pulled out the\\nshabby old volume, and began to turn over the leaves.\\n\\nShe had never cared to look at it but once, having read all the best\\nof its contents in more attractive volumes, so Becky kept it tucked\\naway in the farther corner of her rustic closet, and evidently\\nthought it a safe place to conceal a certain little secret which\\nEmily now discovered. As she turned the stiff pages filled with all\\nsorts of verses, good, bad, and indifferent, a sheet of paper\\nappeared on which was scribbled these lines in school-girl\\nhandwriting:--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOUNTAIN--LAUREL\\n\\n\\n  My bonnie flower, with truest joy\\n    Thy welcome face I see,\\n  The world grows brighter to my eyes,\\n    And summer comes with thee.\\n  My solitude now finds a friend,\\n    And after each hard day,\\n  I in my mountain garden walk,\\n    To rest, or sing, or pray.\\n\\n  All down the rocky slope is spread\\n    Thy veil of rosy snow,\\n  And in the valley by the brook,\\n    Thy deeper blossoms grow.\\n  The barren wilderness grows fair,\\n    Such beauty dost thou give;\\n  And human eyes and Nature’s heart\\n    Rejoice that thou dost live.\\n\\n  Each year I wait thy coming, dear,\\n    Each year I love thee more,\\n  For life grows hard, and much I need\\n    Thy honey for my store.\\n  So, like a hungry bee, I sip\\n    Sweet lessons from thy cup,\\n  And sitting at a flower’s feet,\\n    My soul learns to look up.\\n\\n  No laurels shall I ever win,\\n     No splendid blossoms bear,\\n  But gratefully receive and use\\n   God’s blessed sun and air;\\n  And, blooming where my lot is cast,\\n   Grow happy and content,\\n  Making some barren spot more fair,\\n   For a humble life well spent.\\n\\n“She wrote it herself! I can’t believe it!” said Emily, as she put\\ndown the paper, looking rather startled, for she DID believe it, and\\nfelt as if she had suddenly looked into a fellow-creature’s heart.\\n“I thought her just an ordinary girl, and here she is a poet,\\nwriting verses that make me want to cry! I don’t suppose they ARE\\nvery good, but they seem to come right out of her heart, and touch\\nme with the longing and the patience or the piety in them. Well, I\\nAM surprised!” and Emily read the lines again, seeing the faults\\nmore plainly than before, but still feeling that the girl put\\nherself into them, vainly trying to express what the wild flower was\\nto her in the loneliness which comes to those who have a little\\nspark of the divine fire burning in their souls.\\n\\n“Shall I tell her I’ve found it out? I must! and see if I can’t get\\nher verses printed. Of course she has more tucked away somewhere.\\nThat is what she hums to herself when she’s at work, and won’t tell\\nme about when I ask. Sly thing! to be so bashful and hide her gift.\\nI’ll tease her a bit and see what she says. Oh dear, I wish _I_\\ncould do it! Perhaps she’ll be famous some day, and then I’ll have\\nthe glory of discovering her.”\\n\\nWith that consolation Emily turned over the pages of the ledger and\\nfound several more bits of verse, some very good for an untaught\\ngirl, others very faulty, but all having a certain strength of\\nfeeling and simplicity of language unusual in the effusions of young\\nmaidens at the sentimental age.\\n\\nEmily had a girlish admiration for talent of any kind, and being\\nfond of poetry, was especially pleased to find that her humble\\nfriend possessed the power of writing it. Of course she exaggerated\\nBecky’s talent, and as she waited for her, felt sure that she had\\ndiscovered a feminine Burns among the New Hampshire hills, for all\\nthe verses were about natural and homely objects, touched into\\nbeauty by sweet words or tender sentiment. She had time to build a\\nsplendid castle in the air and settle Becky in it with a crown of\\nglory on her head, before the quiet figure in a faded sunbonnet came\\nslowly up the slope with the glow of sunset on a tired but tranquil\\nface.\\n\\n“Sit here and have a good rest, while I talk to you,” said Emily,\\neager to act the somewhat dramatic scene she had planned. Becky sunk\\nupon the red cushion prepared for her, and sat looking down at the\\nanimated speaker, as Emily, perched on a mossy stone before her,\\nbegan the performance.\\n\\n“Becky, did you ever hear of the Goodale children? They lived in the\\ncountry and wrote poetry and grew to be famous.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, I’ve read their poems and like ‘em very much. Do you know\\n‘em?” and Becky looked interested at once.\\n\\n“No, but I once met a girl who was something like them, only she\\ndidn’t have such an easy time as they did, with a father to help,\\nand a nice Sky-farm, and good luck generally. I’ve tried to write\\nverses myself, but I always get into a muddle, and give it up. This\\nmakes me interested in other girls who CAN do it, and I want to help\\nmy friend. I’m SURE she has talent, and I’d so like to give her a\\nlift in some way. Let me read you a piece of hers and see what you\\nthink of it.”\\n\\n“Do!” and Beck threw off the sunbonnet, folded her hands round her\\nknees, and composed herself to listen with such perfect\\nunconsciousness of what was coming that Emily both laughed at the\\njoke and blushed at the liberty she felt she was taking with the\\npoor girl’s carefully hidden secret.\\n\\nBecky was sure now that Emily was going to read something of her own\\nafter this artful introduction, and began to smile as the paper was\\nproduced and the first four lines read in a tone that was half\\ntimid, half triumphant. Then with a cry she seized and crumpled up\\nthe paper, exclaiming almost fiercely,--\\n\\n“It’s mine! Where did you get it? How dar’st you touch it?”\\n\\nEmily fell upon her knees with a face and voice so full of\\npenitence, pleasure, sympathy, and satisfaction, that Becky’s wrath\\nwas appeased before her friend’s explanation ended with these\\nsoothing and delightful words,--\\n\\n“That’s all, dear, and I beg your pardon. But I’m sure you will be\\nfamous if you keep on, and I shall yet see a volume of poems by\\nRebecca Moore of Rocky Nook, New Hampshire.”\\n\\nBecky hid her face as if shame, surprise, wonder, and joy filled her\\nheart too full and made a few happy tears drop on the hands so worn\\nwith hard work, when they ached to be holding a pen and trying to\\nrecord the fancies that sung in her brain as ceaselessly as the soft\\nsough of the pines or the ripple of the brook murmured in her ear\\nwhen she sat here alone. She could not express the vague longings\\nthat stirred in her soul; she could only feel and dimly strive to\\nunderstand and utter them, with no thought of fame or fortune,--for\\nshe was a humble creature, and never knew that the hardships of her\\nlife were pressing out the virtues of her nature as the tread of\\ncareless feet crush the sweet perfume from wild herbs.\\n\\nPresently she looked up, deeply touched by Emily’s words and\\ncaresses, and her blue eyes shone like stars as her face beamed with\\nsomething finer than mere beauty, for the secrets of her innocent\\nheart were known to this friend now, and it was very sweet to accept\\nthe first draught of confidence and praise.\\n\\n“I don’t mind much, but I was scared for a minute. No one knows but\\nMother, and she laughs at me, though she don’t care if it makes me\\nhappy. I’m glad you like my scribbling, but really I never think or\\nhope of being anybody. I couldn’t, you know! but it’s real nice to\\nhave you say I MIGHT and to make believe for a while.”\\n\\n“But why not, Becky? The Goodale girls did, and half the poets in\\nthe world were poor, ignorant people at first, you know. It only\\nneeds time and help, and the gift will grow, and people see it; and\\nthen the glory and the money will come,” cried Emily, quite carried\\naway by her own enthusiasm and good-will.\\n\\n“Could I get any money by these things?” asked Becky, looking at the\\ncrumpled paper lying under a laurel-bush.\\n\\n“Of course you could, dear! Let me have some of them, and I’ll show\\nyou that I know good poetry when I see it. You will believe if some\\nbank-bills come with the paper the verses appear in, I hope?”\\n\\nBlind to any harm she might do by exciting vain hopes in her\\neagerness to cheer and help, Emily made this rash proposal in all\\ngood faith, meaning to pay for the verses herself if no editor was\\nfound to accept them.\\n\\nBecky looked half bewildered by this brilliant prospect, and took a\\nlong breath, as if some hand had lifted a heavy burden a little way\\nfrom her weary back, for stronger than ambition for herself was love\\nfor her family, and the thought of help for them was sweeter than\\nany dream of fame.\\n\\n“Yes, I would! oh, if I only COULD, I’d be the happiest girl in the\\nworld! But I can’t believe it, Emily. I heard Mrs. Taylor say that\\nonly the VERY BEST poetry paid, and mine is poor stuff, I know well\\nenough.”\\n\\n“Of course it needs polishing and practice and all that; but I’m\\nsure it is oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle we see in\\nthe papers, and I KNOW that some of those pieces ARE paid for,\\nbecause I have a friend who is in a newspaper office, and he told me\\nso. Yours are quaint and simple and some very original. I’m sure\\nthat ballad of the old house is lovely, and I want to send it to\\nWhittier. Mamma knows him; it’s the sort he likes, and he is so kind\\nto every one, he will criticise it, and be interested when she tells\\nhim about you. Do let me!”\\n\\n“I never could in the world! It would be so bold, Mother would think\\nI was crazy. I love Mr. Whittier, but I wouldn’t dar’st to show him\\nmy nonsense, though reading his beautiful poetry helps me ever so\\nmuch.”\\n\\nBecky looked and spoke as if her breath had been taken away by this\\naudacious proposal; and yet a sudden delicious hope sprung up in her\\nheart that there might, perhaps, be a spark of real virtue in the\\nlittle fire which burned within her, warming and brightening her\\ndull life.\\n\\n“Let us ask Mamma; she will tell us what is best to do first, for\\nshe knows all sorts of literary people, and won’t say any more than\\nyou want her to. I’m bent on having my way, Becky, and the more\\nmodest you are, the surer I am that you are a genius. Real geniuses\\nalways ARE shy; so you just make up your mind to give me the best of\\nyour pieces, and let me prove that I’m right.”\\n\\nIt was impossible to resist such persuasive words, and Becky soon\\nyielded to the little siren who was luring her out of her safe,\\nsmall pool into the deeper water that looks so blue and smooth till\\nthe venturesome paper boats get into the swift eddies, or run\\naground upon the rocks and sandbars.\\n\\nThe greatest secrecy was to be preserved, and no one but Mrs.\\nSpenser was to know what a momentous enterprise was afoot. The girls\\nsat absorbed in their brilliant plans till it was nearly dark, then\\ngroped their way home hand in hand, leaving another secret for the\\nlaurels to keep and dream over through their long sleep, for blossom\\ntime was past, and the rosy faces turning pale in the July sun.\\n\\nNeither of the girls forgot the talk they had that night in Emily’s\\nroom, for she led her captive straight to her mother, and told her\\nall their plans and aspirations without a moment’s delay.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser much regretted her daughter’s well-meant enthusiasm,\\nbut fearing harm might be done, very wisely tried to calm the\\ninnocent excitement of both by the quiet matter-of-fact way in which\\nshe listened to the explanation Emily gave her, read the verses\\ntimidly offered by Becky, and then said, kindly but firmly:--\\n\\n“This is not poetry, my dear girls, though the lines run smoothly\\nenough, and the sentiment is sweet. It would bring neither fame nor\\nmoney, and Rebecca puts more real truth, beauty, and poetry into her\\ndutiful daily life than in any lines she has written.”\\n\\n“We had such a lovely plan for Becky to come to town with me, and\\nsee the world, and write, and be famous. How can you spoil it all?”\\n\\n“My foolish little daughter, I must prevent you from spoiling this\\ngood girl’s life by your rash projects. Becky will see that I am\\nwise, though you do not, and SHE will understand this verse from my\\nfavorite poet, and lay it to heart:--\\n\\n  “So near is grandeur to our Dust,\\n   So nigh is God to man,\\n   When Duty whispers low, ‘Thou must!’\\n    The youth replies, ‘I can!’”\\n\\n“I do! I will! please go on,” and Becky’s troubled eyes grew clear\\nand steadfast as she took the words home to herself, resolving to\\nlive up to them.\\n\\n“Oh, mother!” cried Emily, thinking her very cruel to nip their\\nbudding hopes in this way.\\n\\n“I know you won’t believe it now, nor be able to see all that I mean\\nperhaps, but time will teach you both to own that I am right, and to\\nvalue the substance more than the shadow,” continued Mrs. Spenser.\\n“Many girls write verses and think they are poets; but it is only a\\npassing mood, and fortunately for the world, and for them also, it\\nsoon dies out in some more genuine work or passion. Very few have\\nthe real gift, and those to whom it IS given wait and work and\\nslowly reach the height of their powers. Many delude themselves, and\\ntry to persuade the world that they can sing; but it is waste of\\ntime, and ends in disappointment, as the mass of sentimental rubbish\\nwe all see plainly proves. Write your little verses, my dear, when\\nthe spirit moves,--it is a harmless pleasure, a real comfort, and a\\ngood lesson for you; but do not neglect higher duties or deceive\\nyourself with false hopes and vain dreams. ‘First live, then write,’\\nis a good motto for ambitious young people. A still better for us\\nall is, ‘Do the duty that lies nearest;’ and the faithful\\nperformance of that, no matter how humble it is, will be the best\\nhelp for whatever talent may lie hidden in us, ready to bloom when\\nthe time comes. Remember this, and do not let my enthusiastic girl’s\\nwell-meant but unwise prophecies and plans unsettle you, and unfit\\nyou for the noble work you are doing.”\\n\\n“Thank you, ma’am! I WILL remember; I know you are right, and I\\nwon’t be upset by foolish notions. I never imagined before that I\\nCOULD be a poet; but it sounded so sort of splendid, I thought maybe\\nit MIGHT happen to me, by-and-by, as it does to other folks. I\\nwon’t lot on it, but settle right down and do my work cheerful.”\\n\\nAs she listened, Becky’s face had grown pale and serious, even a\\nlittle sad; but as she answered, her eyes shone, her lips were firm,\\nand her plain face almost beautiful with the courage and confidence\\nthat sprung up within her. She saw the wisdom of her friend’s\\nadvice, felt the kindness of showing her the mistake frankly, and\\nwas grateful for it,--conscious in her own strong, loving heart that\\nit was better to live and work for others than to dream and strive\\nfor herself alone.\\n\\nMrs. Spenser was both surprised and touched by the girl’s look,\\nwords, and manner, and her respect much increased by the courage and\\ngood temper with which she saw her lovely castle in the air vanish\\nlike smoke, leaving the hard reality looking harder than ever, after\\nthis little flight into the fairy regions of romance.\\n\\nShe talked long with the girls, and gave them the counsel all eager\\nyoung people need, yet are very slow to accept till experience\\nteaches them its worth. As the friend of many successful literary\\npeople, Mrs. Spenser was constantly receiving the confidences of\\nunfledged scribblers, each of whom was sure that he or she had\\nsomething valuable to add to the world’s literature. Her advice was\\nalways the same, “Work and wait;” and only now and then was a young\\npoet or author found enough in earnest to do both, and thereby prove\\nto themselves and others that either they DID possess power, or did\\nnot, and so settle the question forever. “First live, then write,”\\n proved a quietus for many, and “Do the duty that lies nearest”\\n satisfied the more sincere that they could be happy without fame.\\nSo, thanks to this wise and kindly woman, a large number of worthy\\nyouths and maidens ceased dreaming and fell to work, and the world\\nwas spared reams of feeble verse and third-rate romances.\\n\\nAfter that night Becky spent fewer spare hours in her nest, and more\\nin reading with Emily, who lent her books and helped her to\\nunderstand them,--both much assisted by Mrs. Spenser, who marked\\npassages, suggested authors, and explained whatever puzzled them.\\nVery happy bits of time were these, and very precious to both, as\\nEmily learned to see and appreciate the humbler, harder side of\\nlife, and Becky got delightful glimpses into the beautiful world of\\nart, poetry, and truth, which gave her better food for heart and\\nbrain than sentimental musings or blind efforts to satisfy the\\nhunger of her nature with verse-writing.\\n\\nTheir favorite places were in the big barn, on the front porch, or\\nby the spring. This last was Emily’s schoolroom, and she both taught\\nand learned many useful lessons there.\\n\\nOne day as Becky came to rest a few minutes and shell peas, Emily\\nput down her book to help; and as the pods flew, she said, nodding\\ntoward the delicate ferns that grew thickly all about the trough,\\nthe rock, and the grassy bank,--\\n\\n“We have these in our greenhouse, but I never saw them growing wild\\nbefore, and I don’t find them anywhere up here. How did you get such\\nbeauties, and make them do so well?”\\n\\n“Oh, they grow in nooks on the mountain hidden under the taller\\nferns, and in sly corners. But they don’t grow like these, and die\\nsoon unless transplanted and taken good care of. They always make me\\nthink of you,--so graceful and delicate, and just fit to live with\\ntea-roses in a hot-house, and go to balls in beautiful ladies’\\nbokays,” answered Becky, smiling at her new friend, always so\\ndainty, and still so delicate in spite of the summer’s rustication.\\n\\n“Thank you! I suppose I shall never be very strong or able to do\\nmuch; so I AM rather like a fern, and do live in a conservatory all\\nwinter, as I can’t go out a great deal. An idle thing, Becky!” and\\nEmily sighed, for she was born frail, and even her tenderly guarded\\nlife could not give her the vigor of other girls. But the sigh\\nchanged to a smile as she added,--\\n\\n“If I am like the fern, you are like your own laurel,--strong, rosy,\\nand able to grow anywhere. I want to carry a few roots home, and see\\nif they won’t grow in my garden. Then you will have me, and I you. I\\nonly hope YOUR plant will do as well as mine does here.”\\n\\n“It won’t! ever so many folks have taken roots away, but they never\\nthrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong. So I\\ntell ‘em to leave the dear bushes alone, and come up here and enjoy\\n‘em in their own place. You might keep a plant of it in your\\nhot-house, and it would blow I dare say; but it would never be half\\nso lovely as my acres of them, and I guess it would only make you\\nsad, seeing it so far from home, and pale and pining,” answered\\nBecky, with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountain-laurel\\nbraved the wintry snow, and came out fresh and early in the spring.\\n\\n“Then I’ll let it alone till I come next summer. But don’t you take\\nany of the fern into the house in the cold weather? I should think\\nit would grow in your sunny windows,” said Emily, pleased by the\\nfancy that it resembled herself.\\n\\n“I tried it, but it needs a damp place, and our cold nights kill it.\\nNo, it won’t grow in our old house; but I cover it with leaves, and\\nthe little green sprouts come up as hearty as can be out here. The\\nshade, the spring, the shelter of the rock, keep it alive, you see,\\nso it’s no use trying to move it.”\\n\\nBoth sat silent for a few minutes, as their hands moved briskly and\\nthey thought of their different lots. An inquisitive ray of sunshine\\npeeped in at them, touching Becky’s hair till it shone like red\\ngold. The same ray dazzled Emily’s eyes; she put up her hand to pull\\nher hat-brim lower, and touched the little curls on her forehead.\\nThis recalled her pet grievance, and made her say impatiently, as\\nshe pushed the thick short locks under her net,--\\n\\n“My hair is SUCH a plague! I don’t know what I am to do when I go\\ninto society by-and-by. This crop is so unbecoming, and I can’t\\nmatch my hair anywhere, it is such a peculiar shade of golden-auburn.”\\n\\n“It’s a pretty color, and I think the curls much nicer than a\\nboughten switch,” said Becky, quite unconscious that her own\\nluxuriant locks were of the true Titian red, and would be much\\nadmired by artistic eyes.\\n\\n“I don’t! I shall send to Paris to match it, and then wear a braid\\nround my head as you do sometimes. I suppose it will cost a fortune,\\nbut I WON’T have a strong-minded crop. A friend of mine got a lovely\\ngolden switch for fifty dollars.”\\n\\n“My patience! do folks pay like that for false hair?” asked Becky,\\namazed.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed. White hair costs a hundred, I believe, if it is long.\\nWhy, you could get ever so much for yours if you ever wanted to sell\\nit. I’ll take part of it, for in a little while mine will be as\\ndark, and I’d like to wear your hair, Becky.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe Mother would let me. She is very proud of our red\\nheads. If I ever do cut it, you shall have some. I may be hard up\\nand glad to sell it perhaps. My sakes! I smell the cake burning!”\\n and off flew Becky to forget the chat in her work.\\n\\nEmily did not forget it, and hoped Becky would be tempted, for she\\nreally coveted one of the fine braids, but felt shy about asking the\\npoor girl for even a part of her one beauty.\\n\\nSo July and August passed pleasantly and profitably to both girls,\\nand in September they were to part. No more was said about poetry;\\nand Emily soon became so interested in the busy, practical life\\nabout her that her own high-flown dreams were quite forgotten, and\\nshe learned to enjoy the sweet prose of daily labor.\\n\\nOne breezy afternoon as she and her mother sat resting from a stroll\\non the way-side bank among the golden-rod and asters, they saw Becky\\ncoming up the long hill with a basket on her arm. She walked slowly,\\nas if lost in thought, yet never missed pushing aside with a decided\\ngesture of her foot every stone that lay in her way. There were many\\nin that rocky path, but Becky left it smoother as she climbed, and\\npaused now and then to send some especially sharp or large one\\nspinning into the grassy ditch beside the road.\\n\\n“Isn’t she a curious girl, Mamma? so tired after her long walk to\\ntown, yet so anxious not to leave a stone in the way,” said Emily,\\nas they watched her slow approach.\\n\\n“A very interesting one to me, dear, because under that humble\\nexterior lies a fine, strong character. It is like Becky to clear\\nher way, even up a dusty hill where the first rain will wash out\\nmany more stones. Let us ask her why she does it. I’ve observed the\\nhabit before, and always meant to ask,” replied Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Here we are! Come and rest a minute, Becky, and tell us if you mend\\nroads as well as ever so many other things;” called Emily, beckoning\\nwith a smile, as the girl looked up and saw them.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a trick of mine; I caught it of Father when I was a little\\nthing, and do it without knowing it half the time,” said Becky,\\nsinking down upon a mossy rock, as if rest were welcome.\\n\\n“Why did he do it?” asked Emily, who knew that her friend loved to\\ntalk of her father.\\n\\n“Well, it’s a family failing I guess, for his father did the same,\\nonly HE began with his farm and let the roads alone. The land used\\nto be pretty much all rocks up here, you know, and farmers had to\\nclear the ground if they wanted crops. It was a hard fight, and took\\na sight of time and patience to grub out roots and blast rocks and\\npick up stones that seemed to grow faster than anything else. But\\nthey kept on, and now see!”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Becky pointed proudly to the wide, smooth fields lying\\nbefore them, newly shorn of grass or grain, waving with corn, or\\nrich in garden crops ripening for winter stores. Here and there were\\nrocky strips unreclaimed, as if to show what had been done; and\\nmassive stone walls surrounded pasture, field, and garden.\\n\\n“A good lesson in patience and perseverance, my dear, and does great\\nhonor to the men who made the wilderness blossom like the rose,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser.\\n\\n“Then you can’t wonder that they loved it and we want to keep it. I\\nguess it would break Mother’s heart to sell this place, and we are\\nall working as hard as ever we can to pay off the mortgage. Then\\nwe’ll be just the happiest family in New Hampshire,” said Becky,\\nfondly surveying the old farm-house, the rocky hill, and the\\nprecious fields won from the forest.\\n\\n“You never need fear to lose it; we will see to that if you will let\\nus,” began Mrs. Spenser, who was both a rich and a generous woman.\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! but we won’t need help I guess; and if we should,\\nMrs. Taylor made us promise to come to her,” cried Becky. “She found\\nus just in our hardest time, and wanted to fix things then; but we\\nare proud in our way, and Mother said she’d rather work it off if\\nshe could. Then what did that dear lady do but talk to the folks\\nround here, and show ‘em how a branch railroad down to Peeksville\\nwould increase the value of the land, and how good this valley would\\nbe for strawberries and asparagus and garden truck if we could only\\nget it to market. Some of the rich men took up the plan, and we hope\\nit will be done this fall. It will be the making of us, for our land\\nis first-rate for small crops, and the children can help at that,\\nand with a deepot close by it would be such easy work. That’s what I\\ncall helping folks to help themselves. Won’t it be grand?”\\n\\nBecky looked so enthusiastic that Emily could not remain\\nuninterested, though market-gardening did not sound very romantic.\\n\\n“I hope it will come, and next year we shall see you all hard at it.\\nWhat a good woman Mrs. Taylor is!”\\n\\n“Ain’t she? and the sad part of it is, she can’t do and enjoy all\\nshe wants to, because her health is so poor. She was a country girl,\\nyou know, and went to work in the city as waiter in a boarding-house.\\nA rich man fell in love with her and married her, and she took care\\nof him for years, and he left her all his money. She was quite broken\\ndown, but she wanted to make his name loved and honored after his\\ndeath, as he hadn’t done any good while he lived; so she gives away\\nheaps, and is never tired of helping poor folks and doing all sorts\\nof grand things to make the world better. I call that splendid!”\\n\\n“So do I, yet it is only what you are doing in a small way, Becky,”\\n said Mrs. Spenser, as the girl paused out of breath. “Mrs. Taylor\\nclears the stones out of people’s paths, making their road easier to\\nclimb than hers has been, and leaving behind her fruitful fields for\\nothers to reap. This is a better work than making verses, for it is\\nthe real poetry of life, and brings to those who give themselves to\\nit, no matter in what humble ways, something sweeter than fame and\\nmore enduring than fortune.”\\n\\n“So it does! I see that now, and know why we love Father as we do,\\nand want to keep what he worked so hard to give us. He used to say\\nevery stone cleared away was just so much help to the boys; and he\\nused to tell me his plans as I trotted after him round the farm,\\nhelping all I could, being the oldest, and like him, he said.”\\n\\nBecky paused with full eyes, for not even to these good friends\\ncould she ever tell the shifts and struggles in which she had\\nbravely borne her part during the long hard years that had wrested\\nthe little homestead from the stony-hearted hills.\\n\\nThe musical chime of a distant clock reminded her that supper time\\nwas near, and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant\\nrest by the way-side. As she pulled out her handkerchief, a little\\nroll of pale blue ribbon fell from her pocket, and Emily caught it\\nup, exclaiming mischievously, “Are you going to make yourself fine\\nnext Sunday, when Moses Pennel calls, Becky?”\\n\\nThe girl laughed and blushed as she said, carefully folding up the\\nribbon,--\\n\\n“I’m going to do something with it that I like a sight better than\\nthat. Poor Moses won’t come any more, I guess. I’m not going to\\nleave Mother till the girls can take my place, and only then to\\nteach, if I can get a good school somewhere near.”\\n\\n“We shall see!” and Emily nodded wisely.\\n\\n“We shall!” and Becky nodded decidedly, as she trudged on up the\\nsteep hill beside Mrs. Spenser, while Emily walked slowly behind,\\npoking every stone she saw into the grass, unmindful of the\\ndetriment to her delicate shoes, being absorbed in a new and\\ncharming idea of trying to follow Mrs. Taylor’s example in a small\\nway.\\n\\nA week later the last night came, and just as they were parting for\\nbed, in rushed one of the boys with the exciting news that the\\nrailroad surveyors were in town, the folks talking about the grand\\nenterprise, and the fortune of the place made forever.\\n\\nGreat was the rejoicing in the old farm-house; the boys cheered, the\\nlittle girls danced, the two mothers dropped a happy tear as they\\nshook each other’s hands, and Emily embraced Becky, tenderly\\nexclaiming,--“There, you dear thing, is a great stone shoved out of\\nYOUR way, and a clear road to fortune at last; for I shall tell all\\nmy friends to buy your butter and eggs, and fruit and pigs, and\\neverything you send to market on that blessed railroad.”\\n\\n“A keg of our best winter butter is going by stage express to-morrow\\nanyway; and when our apples come, we shan’t need a railroad to get\\n‘em to you, my darling dear,” answered Becky, holding the delicate\\ngirl in her arms with a look and gesture half sisterly, half\\nmotherly, wholly fond and grateful.\\n\\nWhen Emily got to her room, she found that butter and apples were\\nnot all the humble souvenirs offered in return for many comfortable\\ngifts to the whole family.\\n\\nOn the table, in a pretty birch-bark cover, lay several of Becky’s\\nbest poems neatly copied, as Emily had expressed a wish to keep\\nthem; and round the rustic volume, like a ring of red gold, lay a\\ngreat braid of Becky’s hair, tied with the pale blue ribbon she had\\nwalked four miles to buy, that her present might look its best.\\n\\nOf course there were more embraces and kisses, and thanks and loving\\nwords, before Emily at last lulled herself to sleep planning a\\nChristmas box, which should supply every wish and want of the entire\\nfamily if she could find them out.\\n\\nNext morning they parted; but these were not mere summer friends,\\nand they did not lose sight of one another, though their ways lay\\nfar apart. Emily had found a new luxury to bring more pleasure into\\nlife, a new medicine to strengthen soul and body; and in helping\\nothers, she helped herself wonderfully.\\n\\nBecky went steadily on her dutiful way, till the homestead was free,\\nthe lads able to work the farm alone, the girls old enough to fill\\nher place, and the good mother willing to rest at last among her\\nchildren. Then Becky gave herself to teaching,--a noble task, for\\nwhich she was well fitted, and in which she found both profit and\\npleasure, as she led her flock along the paths from which she\\nremoved the stumbling-blocks for their feet, as well as for her\\nown. She put her poetry into her life, and made of it “a grand sweet\\nsong” in which beauty and duty rhymed so well that the country girl\\nbecame a more useful, beloved, and honored woman than if she had\\ntried to sing for fame which never satisfies.\\n\\nSo each symbolical plant stood in its own place, and lived its\\nappointed life. The delicate fern grew in the conservatory among\\ntea-roses and camelias, adding grace to every bouquet of which it\\nformed a part, whether it faded in a ball-room, or was carefully\\ncherished by some poor invalid’s bed-side,--a frail thing, yet with\\ntenacious roots and strong stem, nourished by memories of the rocky\\nnook where it had learned its lesson so well. The mountain-laurel\\nclung to the bleak hillside, careless of wintry wind and snow, as\\nits sturdy branches spread year by year, with its evergreen leaves\\nfor Christmas cheer, its rosy flowers for spring-time, its fresh\\nbeauty free to all as it clothed the wild valley with a charm that\\nmade a little poem of the lovely spot where the pines whispered,\\nwoodbirds sang, and the hidden brook told the sweet message it\\nbrought from the mountain-top where it was born.\\n\\n\\nThe End.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s A Garland for Girls, by Louisa May Alcott\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A GARLAND FOR GIRLS ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 5830-0.txt or 5830-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/3/5830/\\n\\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo and the Online Distributed\\nProofreading Team\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n']]"
