    "With only the tools we learned in the last class we can do a good amount of text analysis. No special libraries or functions, just counting. \n",

    "### Lesson Goals\n",
    "* Get comfortable reading a text into Python and manipulating it\n",
    "* Apply Wednesday's lesson and do simple counts on a text\n",
    "* Start building more comfort with the Python programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "* On your own, use the tools we have already learned to answer a few questions about two novels\n",
    "* In small groups, compare your solutions and discuss any differences\n",
    "* Discuss in the larger group\n",

    "Now that we have some of Python's basics in our toolkit, we can immediately perform the kinds of tasks that are the bread and butter of text analysis: counting. When we first meet a text in the wild, we often wish to find out a little about it before digging in deeply, so we start with simple questions like \"How many words are in this text?\" or \"What is the average word length?\""
