    "# Accuracy Measures for Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we used a simple accuracy measure to test the accuracy of our machine learning algorithm. It's helpful also to calculate more precise accuracy scores for each category. We can do this using precision, recall, and the F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following text is taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification task, the precision for a class is the number of true positives (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. precision at a recall level of 0.75) or both are combined into a single measure. Examples for measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall)\n",
    "\n",

    "The equations for Precision, Recall, and the F1 Score:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can print out the *confusion matrix* to see exactly which labels are most \"confusing\" for the algorithm, or how many documents are being misclassified for each label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* *precision*\n",
    "    * the precision for a class is the number of true positives (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class).\n",
    "* *recall*\n",
    "    * Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\n",
    "* *F1 score*\n",
    "    * The harmonic mean between precision and recall.\n",
    "* [*Confusion Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)\n",
    "    * In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix). Each column of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each row represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa). The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes (i.e. commonly mislabelling one as another).\n",
