    "### 0. Installation Check\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's make sure Python is installed. If you receive no errors in this section, then your computer is ready to run the materials for this course! If you do receive an error, read the message closely since it offers clues to resolving the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks consist of cells. The cell we're reading now is formatted as a \"Markdown\" cell, and is used for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Python code we need cells that are formatted as \"Code\" cells. A code cell has a \"In [ ]\" to the left of the cell. Running code in a Jupyter notebook is relatively easy. Click on the cell you wish to run (a segment of code with a gray background) in order to highlight it. Then either click the \"Play\" button in the toolbar above the code window or press CTRL+RETURN on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the semester we will try to build a community of practice around programming and its applications to research on human-language texts. One facet of this effort will be a shared repository of knowledge regarding bugs and Python itself. To that end, we ask that each time you get an error message, you create a new thread on the bCourses page for this course. We hope to see dialogue around its resolution as well as a record that we can refer back to later. \n",

    "After all, if you see an error message, it's almost certain that someone else will get it too.\n",
